One of the most powerful tools in faults detection and diagnosis is artificial intelligence AI . Faults should be detected early so correct mitigation measures can be taken, whilst false alarms should be eschewed to avoid unnecessary interruption and downtime. For the last few decades there has been major interest towards intelligent condition monitoring system ICMS application in power plant especially with AI development particularly in artificial neural network ANN . ANN is based on quite simple principles, but takes advantage of their mathematical nature, non linear iteration to demonstrate powerful problem solving ability. With massive possibility and room for improvement in AI, the inspiration for researching them are apparent, and literally, hundreds of papers have been published, discussing the findings of hybrid AI for condition monitoring purposes. In this paper, the studies of ANN and fuzzy logic application will be presented. P. Naveen | S. Nikitha | P. Sudeesh | V.

       "  'abstract': \"There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.\",\n",

Artificial intelligence has advanced to occupy a position of paramount importance in Science, but seldom do we associate it with Human Creativity in general, and with Modern Art in particular. Creativity is one of the rudimentary constituents of the functioning of machines. By using algorithms, machines churn out representations of shapes, images and structures. Machines are perpetually expanding, redefining and reinventing creativity in their own right. This idea has triggered the birth of a new subfield in Artificial Intelligence known as Computational Creativity.

Symbolic artificial intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data, and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for downstream processing.

The author will be dealing with the given title by dividing it into two branches: roboethics and machine ethics along with their moral values and role in technology. In the roboethics section, the author clearly explains about the characteristics and behaviour of a robot and the problems caused by it and how it poses as a threat to human beings. In the second part, the author differentiates between roboethics and machine ethics. Machine ethics only refers to computed machine which are designed by humans and their moral behaviour. Moreover, the author has discussed in detail about societal moral values of artificial intelligence and how it tends to threaten human and future technology in terms of philosophy and law. Only moral values and the ethics behind the technology governing the artificial intelligence exists in the present and there is no law to formally punish crimes that deals with AI. To revolutionise the current scenario, the author widely takes the topic into several dimensions regarding governance and other ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. One way to overcome the difficulty in governing artificial intelligence, as suggested by the author, is to obtain patents for the inventions and eventually this would fall under the category of intellectual property rights. Many countries like the UK, USA and Japan have proposed to include artificial intelligence under intellectual property and this process is in progression. Few other countries are at the developing stages for devising laws that concern artificial intelligence, because this branch of engineering is an emerging one. By moving on to the second part of this paper, the author describes AI\\' influence on human race. The super intelligent machines created by a human may put an end to another human\\' life. Next comes the issue of employment disability which will be illustrated elaborately. This paper concludes by reviewing both positive and negative aspects concerning AI: how it aids in improving technology and bringing a developed society and how it steals jobs that employed humans and the danger it causes Rishikesh R\"Role of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence\" Published in International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (ijtsrd), ISSN: 2456-6470, Volume-2 | Issue-5 , August 2018, URL: http://www.ijtsrd.com/papers/ijtsrd17135.pdf http://www.ijtsrd.com/engineering/computer-engineering/17135/role-of-ethics-in-artificial-intelligence/rishikesh-r',\n",

One of the emerging methods for increasing trust in AI systems is to use eXplainable AI (XAI), which promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions AI systems make. Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AI - Artificial Intelligence has a considerably different meaning, unique things and diverse functions. Each person looks at it as a distinct theory, an artificial human created core and computer development program, and a system that requires human intelligence and performs special tasks beyond human capacity, such as decision-making, speech recognition, visual perception, and translation of languages.The theory and practice of AI have an origin dating back to 1950 and thereafter, a gradual progress was made to substantiate its precise meaning and performance. Considering the rising number of virtual world providing an implicit significance to its theory and practice for the last several decades, an acute interest in AI has now reignited. The dynamic and rapid technological and scientific development pace of AI has created difficulty to predict precisely what path we should take to enable us to alter this world in ways we need to comprehend it, resulting in policies and laws to remain one step at the back of all the technological development.The human beings are very sophisticated and robust intellectual living gadgets on the mother earth, as we have our own intelligence to take decisions, and therefore, we ruled and controlled other living creatures of this planet. In the course of time, we learned and acquired various dynamic skills, necessary for survival, yet, our search process went further to explore more than what we have and wanted. The infinite intelligence having no boundaries started to visualize and invent means to help us save more time and to ensure better health, more security and safety and thus ventured to formulate and devise machines that can extend our intellectual capacity for the multitask activities, and memorizing more information than available presently. Hence, while imagining the ways to improve our functioning, the first Analytical Engine, Turing-Complete computing machine was invented in 1833 by Charles Babbage, and from that time, the computer machines have transformed Analog era towards the Digital Era. In short, AI is a computational human behavior model, which programs and externally behaves like humans. It is a human extended thought of the computational model, with specific programs that internally operates like humans do.

The change of preference was due to a vast emerging concept called ÄU\"\\x9d. AU is the use or introduction of automatic equipment in the process of manufacturing or other processes and facility. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the concept that evolved from AU. Artificial Intelligence is the process of simulation of human intelligence in machines. Humans are unaware of the fact that their job opportunities are being taken over by a machine simulated by human intelligence. In recent years, many law firms started to engage their firms with an AI in their legal research. Our paper traces the evolution of the relationship between technology and human productivity from a contemporary perspective with special reference to HR as well as speculates on the possible answers to emerging problems. The main question is whether an AI taking over the legal sector or any other sectors affects the basic HR? HR is a right which is believed to belong to every person.

       "  'abstract': 'Suicide has been major death cause from an over decade now. The ideation of suicide and its thought process leads to a very dangerous after effect. Since social media is very trending factor now a day’s, it can be used to detect suicide ideation. Artificial intelligence which is used for tasks like problem solving, spam filter, speech recognition etc. can also be used for detect suicides over social media. This study is aimed in designing an automated classifier which can detect suicidal thoughts with the help of algorithmic approach by studying various patterns in the discussions or communications. This paper also studies the previous attempts made for the design of such architecture. At the end we conclude the feasibility and practicability of the approach that we are going to use for the detection of suicide attempts on social media.

It was perhaps this imagination by the artists that led science on the path of inventing artificial intelligence in the first place. However, as things have advanced, science and AI have proven themselves to be much more than merely helpful for mankind so far. Machines have a long way to go before they reach the point envisioned by Asimov as they are still dependent on people to make moral judgment.

Machine learning (ML) has also been successfully applied to the\\r\\nclassification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of post-operative\\r\\ncomplications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and\\r\\nrefractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading\\r\\ndisability via eye tracking.

The formalism makes no presuppositions about the representation of primitive data structures and control structures. Such structures can be programmed, micro-coded, or hard wired in a uniform modular fashion. In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is \"really\" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives. The formalism achieves the goals that the disallowed constructs are intended to achieve by other more structured methods.',\n",

This in depth analysis examines the several ways in which AI is transforming healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, drug research, patient management, and administrative procedures. To lay a strong foundation for understanding AI, machine learning, and deep learning applications in healthcare, the examination begins with clarifying their core principles. It explores how AI might be used to analyze large scale, intricate medical datasets including electronic health records EHRs , medical imaging, and genomes, enabling the early detection of disease, precise diagnosis, and tailored therapy recommendations. Additionally, AI driven technologies like natural language processing NLP have demonstrated considerable potential in extracting important insights from unstructured clinical notes and research literature, supporting clinical decision support and medical research. AI powered robotics and automation have also begun to play crucial roles in rehabilitation and minimally invasive surgery, lowering the invasiveness of operations and speeding up patient recovery. The review emphasizes the efforts that are still being made to create AI driven drug discovery systems that hasten the identification of new treatments and enhance the layouts of clinical trials. By examining trends and patterns in healthcare data, it also examines AIs function in predictive analytics, predicting disease outbreaks, and enhancing population health management. Furthermore, in the context of optimizing healthcare operations and lowering administrative duties, the contribution of AI to administrative tasks such as medical billing, fraud detection, and resource allocation is considered. The review emphasizes the significance of privacy, transparency, and responsible AI deployment while highlighting the ethical and regulatory concerns involved with AI in healthcare. In order to fully realize the potential of AI, it also analyzes potential adoption barriers and the necessity of interdisciplinary cooperation between healthcare experts, data scientists, and legislators. In conclusion, this in depth analysis offers a complete overview of how AI is altering healthcare and provides insights into its present successes and potential in the future. This effort intends to spur innovation, educate stakeholders, and open the door for a more effective, patient centered, and accessible healthcare ecosystem by shedding light on the revolutionary effects of AI on healthcare.

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining\\r\\nlarge language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a\\r\\nvariety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and\\r\\ncognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an\\r\\nunprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our\\r\\ninvestigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active\\r\\ndevelopment by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of\\r\\na new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that\\r\\nexhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the\\r\\nrising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that,\\r\\nbeyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that\\r\\nspan mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without\\r\\nneeding any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's\\r\\nperformance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly\\r\\nsurpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's\\r\\ncapabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet\\r\\nstill incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.\\r\\nIn our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its\\r\\nlimitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper\\r\\nand more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for\\r\\npursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

The evaluation of employee performance is a very important task as it shows how the employees skills are improving. The HR department is responsible for this task. The employee performance evaluation is complex and time consuming. In the last decade, information technology tools have undergone a huge evolution and can help with this complex task. Artificial Intelligence AI is a recent science that consists of building systems that imitate human behavior. It is widely used in many applications like healthcare, banking, and finance. This thesis focuses on studying the impact of artificial intelligence on the employee evaluation process. An analytical descriptive methodology was used. Intelligence is considered an independent variable. However, employee performance evaluation is the dependent variable DV . Four dimensions of the DV were considered objectives and key results, skills gap analysis, tracking training completion, and project or task management tools. A questionnaire of 34 items was built and distributed to the IT employees of the Babylon Education Directorate. 295 answers were collected. SPSS software was used to examine the answers. The MANOVA test was applied to validate the study hypotheses. The result shows that AI has a significant positive impact on the evaluation of employees performance in all dimensions.

In three paradigms, AI techniques are used to address educational and learning issues in varied ways. AI is used to represent knowledge models and direct cognitive learning while learners are recipients of AI service in Paradigm One; AI is used to support learning while learners work as collaborators with AI in Paradigm Two; AI is used to empower learning while learners take agency to learn in Paradigm Three.

       "  'abstract': 'In the past twenty years, much time, effort, and money has been expended on designing an unambiguous representation of natural language to make them accessible to computer processing, These efforts have centered around creating schemata designed to parallel logical relations with relations expressed by the syntax and semantics of natural languages, which are clearly cumbersome and ambiguous in their function as vehicles for the transmission of logical data. Understandably, there is a widespread belief that natural languages are unsuitable for the transmission of many ideas that artificial languages can render with great precision and mathematical rigor. But this dichotomy, which has served as a premise underlying much work in the areas of linguistics and artificial intelligence, is a false one. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old. First, a typical Knowledge Representation Scheme (using Semantic Nets) will be laid out, followed by an outline of the method used by the ancient Indian grammarians to analyze sentences unambiguously. Finally, the clear parallelism between the two will be demonstrated, and the theoretical implications of this equivalence will be given.',\n",

AI has the potential to transform the social interactions in educational contexts among learners, teachers, and technologies. In this systematic mapping review, we focus on mapping and framing trends for educational applications of AI in simulation-based learning. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We coded and analyzed six mapped categories in this literature review: (1) the year-of-study trend, (2) methods, (3) AI technologies, (4) simulation, (5) study trends, and (6) learning principles and theories. To provide nuanced details from the included literature, we also synthesized three thematic trends: (1) AI built in virtual agents for simulation-based learning, (2) AI infused in simulation-based learning with affective computing, and (3) AI leveraged in simulation-based learning for assessments. Trend One builds on a general acknowledgement of virtual agents as a guide for situated learning. Trend Two posits the role of affective states in learning trajectories and suggests the related machine learning approaches. Trend Three discusses machine learning techniques and multimodal computing used for assessment and feedback.

       "  'abstract': \"Given the foreseeable pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence in modern societies, it is legitimate and necessary to ask the question how this new technology must be shaped to support the maintenance and strengthening of constitutional democracy. This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of Democracy, Rule of law and Human Rights by design in AI and a three level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The world has gradually embraced Cryptocurrency at various levels of capacity and it is not governed or regulated by any Control system. It has over time been used by participants as a means to invest despite the volatility of the market. Though Government does not have the means to outright stop the virtual marketing deals of Cryptocurrency, recently Nigerian government called for deposit money banks to close all corresponding accounts which are perceived to be involved in Cryptocurrency trading. The Crypto market has evolved as the digital and internet world exponentially evolved. Sadly, Cryptocurrency has been misused by illegal participants and exploited wrongly which has caused a lot of worrisome issues around the world like loss of funds, hacking of financial databases, terrorist financing, and identity fraud. This paper aims to identify the methodology surrounding the world of Cryptocurrency and how advancement in technology through artificial intelligence can help solve ethical issues related to cryptocurrency trading. Based on these appraisals, we highlighted procedures to provide a safer, secure, and relatable market for every interested individual.',\n",

As an emerging field in industrial applications and an effective solution for fault recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry. However, great challenges are met by the AI methods under the different real operating conditions. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of AI algorithms in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, from both the views of theory background and industrial applications. A brief introduction of different AI algorithms is presented first, including the following methods: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support vector machine, artificial neural network and deep learning. Then, a broad literature survey of these AI algorithms in industrial applications is given. Finally, the advantages, limitations, practical implications of different AI algorithms, as well as some new research trends, are discussed.',\n",

The model of wind turbine is based on the steady state power characteristics of the turbine. The stiffness of the drive train is infinite and the friction factor and the inertia of the turbine must be combined with those of the generator coupled to the turbine. In this paper, variable speed wind turbine driving permanent magnet synchronous generator with current controlled voltage source inverter has been proposed. Detailed modeling and control strategies of the overall system has been developed. It is found that under the proposed control strategy the system runs smoothly under randomly and quickly varying wind condition. During both symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions, the system is found stable. Results shows that by using Current Source Inverter CSI stability of wind power can be achieved. By using CSI based Controller voltage source inverter or any separate storage energy system is not required. A model is used to determine the behavior of the wind turbine, induction generator and load.

The results imply that companies should do their best to promote and facilitate the engagement of ICT and AI to improve their HRM performance as well as their information system, which will produce positive results for the company structure.

       "  'abstract': \"This chapter traces the ethical issues around applying artificial intelligence (AI) in education from the early days of artificial intelligence in education in the 1970s to the current state of this field, including the increasing sophistication of the system interfaces and the rise in data use and misuse. While in the early days most tools were largely learner-facing, now there are tools that are teacher-facing, supporting their management of the classroom, and administrator-facing, assisting in their management of cohorts of students. Learner-facing tools now take into account the affective and motivational aspects of learning as well as the cognitive. The rise of data collection and its associated analytic tools has enabled the development of dashboards for the dynamic management and reflective understanding of learners, teachers, and administrators. Ethical issues hardly figured in the early days of the field but now they loom large. This is because of the legitimate fears that learners' and teachers' autonomy will be compromised, that learner data will be collected and potentially misappropriated for other purposes, and that AI will introduce extra biases into educational decisions and increase existing inequity and also because of the scary reputation that AI has in general.\",\n",

The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment. Most if not all AI problems can easily be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. The discussion includes formal definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem and relations to other approaches to AI. One intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.\",\n",

Earth observation (EO) and remote sensing (RS) research relies heavily on both big data and AI or machine learning (ML). While this reliance is not new, with increasing image resolutions and the growing number of EO/RS use cases that have a direct impact on governance, policy, and the lives of people, ethical issues are taking center stage. In this article, we provide scientists engaged with AI for EO (AI4EO) research, 1) a practically useful overview of the key ethical issues emerging in this field, with concrete examples from within EO/RS to explain these issues, and 2) a first road map (flowchart) that scientists can use to identify ethical issues in their ongoing research. With this, we aim to sensitize scientists to these issues and create a bridge to facilitate constructive and regular communication among scientists engaged in AI4EO research, on the one hand, and ethics research, on the other hand. The article also provides detailed illustrations from four AI4EO research fields to explain how scientists can redesign research questions to more effectively grab ethical opportunities to address real-world problems that are otherwise akin to ethical dilemmas with no win-win solution in sight. The article concludes by providing recommendations to institutions that want to support ethically mindful AI4EO research and provides suggestions for future research in this field.',\n",

Focus is on the specific ways in which outsourcing of data tasks to myriad ‘micro-workers’, recruited and managed through specialized platforms, powers virtual assistants, self-driving vehicles and connected objects. Using qualitative data from multiple sources, we show that micro-work performs a variety of functions, between three poles that we label, respectively, ‘artificial intelligence preparation’, ‘artificial intelligence verification’ and ‘artificial intelligence impersonation’. Because of the wide scope of application of micro-work, it is a structural component of contemporary artificial intelligence production processes – not an ephemeral form of support that may vanish once the technology reaches maturity stage.

Instead, I have attempted here to describe fundamental AI ideas that underlie many of these applications. My organization of these ideas is not, then, based on the subject matter of their application, but is, instead, based on general computational concepts involving the kinds of data structures used, the types of operations performed on these data structures, and the properties of control strategies used by AI systems. I stress, in particular, the important roles played in AI by generalized production systems and the predicate calculus. The notes on which the book is based evolved in courses and seminars at Stanford University and at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

       "  'abstract': 'The living cell exists by virtue of thousands of nonlinearly interacting processes. This complexity greatly impedes its understanding. The standard approach to the calculation of the behaviour of the living cell, or part thereof, integrates all the rate equations of the individual processes. If successful extremely intensive calculations often lead the calculation of coherent, apparently simple, cellular \"decisions\" taken in response to a signal: the complexity of the behavior of the cell is often smaller than it might have been. The \"decisions\" correspond to the activation of entire functional units of molecular processes, rather than individual ones. The limited complexity of signal and response suggests that there might be a simpler way to model at least some important aspects of cell function. In the field of Artificial Intelligence, such simpler modelling methods for complex systems have been developed. In this paper, it is shown how the Artificial Intelligence description method for deliberative agents functioning on the basis of beliefs, desires and intentions as known in Artificial Intelligence, can be used successfully to describe essential aspects of cellular regulation. This is demonstrated for catabolite repression and substrate induction phenomena in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The method becomes highly efficient when the computation is automated in a Prolog implementation. By defining in a qualitative way the food supply of the bacterium, the make-up of its catabolic pathways is readily calculated for cases that are sufficiently complex to make the traditional human reasoning tedious and error prone.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the coming decades, Artificial Intelligence will profoundly impact the way we live, work, wage war, play, seek a mate, educate our young, and care for our elderly. It is likely to greatly increase our aggregate wealth, but it will also upend our labor markets, reshuffle our social order, and strain our private and public institutions. Eventually it may alter how we see our place in the universe, as machines pursue goals independent of their creators and outperform us in domains previously believed to be the sole dominion of humans. Whether we regard them as conscious or unwitting, revere them as a new form of life or dismiss them as mere clever appliances, is beside the point. They are likely to play an increasingly critical and intimate role in many aspects of our lives. The emergence of systems capable of independent reasoning and action raises serious questions about just whose interests they are permitted to serve, and what limits our society should place on their creation and use. Deep ethical questions that have bedeviled philosophers for ages will suddenly arrive on the steps of our courthouses. Can a machine be held accountable for its actions? Should intelligent systems enjoy independent rights and responsibilities, or are they simple property? Who should be held responsible when a self-driving car kills a pedestrian? Can your personal robot hold your place in line, or be compelled to testify against you? If it turns out to be possible to upload your mind into a machine, is that still you?

Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of Artificial Intelligence is to develop the machines to perform the tasks in a better way than the humans. Another aim of Artificial Intelligence is to understand the actions whether it occurs in humans, machines or animals. As a result, Artificial Intelligence is gaining Importance in science and engineering fields. The use of Artificial Intelligence in medical diagnosis too is becoming increasingly common and has been used widely in the diagnosis of cancers, tumors, hepatitis, lung diseases, etc... The main aim of this paper is to build an Artificial Intelligent System that after analysis of certain parameters can predict that whether a person is diabetic or not. Diabetes is the name used to describe a metabolic condition of having higher than normal blood sugar levels. Diabetes is becoming increasingly more common throughout the world, due to increased obesity - which can lead to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes leading to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes. Authors have identified 10 parameters that play an important role in diabetes and prepared a rich database of training data which served as the backbone of the prediction algorithm. Keeping in view this training data authors developed a system that uses the artificial neural networks algorithm to serve the purpose. These are capable of predicting new observations (on specific variables) from previous observations (on the same or other variables) after executing a process of so-called learning from existing training data (Haykin1998).The results indicate that the ANN is the best predictor with the accuracy of about 96%. This system can be used to assist medical programs especially in geographically remote areas where expert human diagnosis not possible with an advantage of minimal expenses and faster results.

There has been a lot of disagreement among commentators and specialists about the nature of artificial intelligence as a speciality. This makes AI an interesting case of an emerging speciality. We use aggregated journal-journal citations for describing artificial intelligence as sets of journals; factor analytic techniques are used to analyze the development of AI in terms of (an emerging) stability and coherency of the journal sets during the period 1982-1992. The analysis teaches us that AI has emerged as a set of journals with the characteristics of a discipline only since 1988. The thereafter relatively stable set of journals includes both fundamental and applied AI journals, and journals with a focus on expert systems. Additionally, specialities related to artificial intelligence (like pattern analysis, computer science, cognitive psychology) are identified. Neural network research is a part neither of AI nor of its direct citation environment. Information science is related to AI only in the early eighties.

The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities.

Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the<br>environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. <br> <br>This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed<br>functioning.

In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and<br>information.

The exponential progress of AI in the recent decade demonstrates its promise as a platform for optimum decisionmaking by superintelligence, since the human mind is constrained to processing large amounts of data in a short period of time. Cancer is a complex disease with hundreds of genetic and epigenetic variants. AI-based techniques show significant potential for identifying these genetic alterations and abnormal protein interactions at an early stage. Modern biomedical research is also focused on bringing AI technologies to clinics in a safe and ethical manner. AI-based help to pathologists and clinicians might be a huge step forward in disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy prediction. AI and Machine Learning (ML) clinical applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy are the future of medical guidance toward speedier mapping of a new treatment for each person. Researchers may cooperate in realtime and exchange information digitally by employing an AI base system method, which has the potential to treat millions. We concentrated on presenting gamechanging technologies of the future in clinics by linking biology with Artificial Intelligence and explaining how AIbased aid helps oncologists for accurate therapy in this evaluation.',\n",

Organizations are adopting new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) to support work processes, such as hiring processes or innovation facilitation, which could shape a new era of work practices. However, it has not been studied how AI applications can or should support onboarding.

Jacques Monod wrote: 'A curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks heunderstands it'. Nonetheless the problem seems to be unusually acute in Artificial Intelligence. The field of AI has a reputation for making huge promises and then failing to deliver on them. Most observers conclude that AI is hard; as indeed it is. But the embarrassment does not stem from the difficulty. It is difficult to build a star from hydrogen, but the field of stellar astronomy does not have a terrible reputation for promising to build stars and then failing. The critical inference is not that AI is hard, but that, for some reason, it is very easy for people to think they know far more about Artificial Intelligence than they actually do. I think it is possible for mere fallible humans to succeed on the challenge of building Friendly AI. But only if intelligence ceases to be a sacred mystery to us, as life was a sacred mystery to Lord Kelvin. Intelligence must cease to be any kind of mystery whatever, sacred or not. We must execute the creation of Artificial Intelligence as the exact application of an exact art. And maybe then we can win.\",\n",

A dataset is imbalanced if the    classification categories are not approximately equally    represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of    ``normal'' examples with only a small percentage of ``abnormal'' or    ``interesting'' examples. It is also the case that the cost of    misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example    is often much higher than the cost of the reverse    error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed    as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the    minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of    over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the    majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in    ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class.  This paper    also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the    minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve    better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss    ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of    over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority    class examples.  Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a    Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under    the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex    hull strategy.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is essential to utilize deep-learning algorithms based on big data for the implementation of the new generation of artificial intelligence. Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set. Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples. Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This research is also expected to contribute to the comprehensive promotion of new-generation artificial intelligence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In November 2020, OpenAI officially launched their new generation of generative artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, based on large language models. ChatGPT garnered the attention and usage of over a billion people in less than two months, making it the fastest consumer level application to reach this milestone. As a generative AI, ChatGPT not only achieved remarkable success in the market but also contributed to the advancements in the field of generative AI, with its representation of 2022s top ten scientific breakthroughs in the international reputable journal, Science. Generative artificial intelligence is having a profound impact on our lives and work, with one of the most critical aspects being its algorithms. These algorithms directly influence the learning performance of the entire intelligent system and the quality of recommendations. However, with the widespread application of algorithms and the continuous evolution of artificial intelligence, a series of regulatory and management issues have arisen. Many countries worldwide are continually strengthening algorithm oversight to ensure transparency, fairness, and security. This project, part of a university student innovation training program, will primarily focus on researching personal information security risks among the potential risks associated with generative artificial intelligence. The following will provide an introduction to what generative artificial intelligence is, the personal information security risks and preventive measures involved in generative artificial intelligence.

       "  'abstract': 'My 1971 Turing Award Lecture was entitled \"Generality in Artificial\\n\\tIntelligence.\" The topic turned out to have been overambitious in\\n\\tthat I discovered I was unable to put my thoughts on the subject\\n\\tin a satisfactory written form at that time. It would have been better\\n\\tto have reviewed my previous work rather than attempt something new,\\n\\tbut such was not my custom at that time. I am grateful to ACM for\\n\\tthe opportunity to try again. Unfortunately for our science, although\\n\\tperhaps fortunately for this project, the problem of generality in\\n\\tartificial intelligence (AI) is almost as unsolved as ever, although\\n\\twe now have many ideas not available in 1971. This paper relies heavily\\n\\ton such ideas, but it is far from a full 1987 survey of approaches\\n\\tfor achieving generality. Ideas are therefore discussed at a length\\n\\tproportional to my familiarity with them rather than according to\\n\\tsome objective criterion. It was obvious in 1971 and even in 1958\\n\\tthat AI programs suffered from a lack of generality. It is still\\n\\tobvious; there are many more details. The first gross symptom is\\n\\tthat a small addition to the idea of a program often involves a complete\\n\\trewrite beginning with the data structures. Some progress has been\\n\\tmade in modularizing data structures, but small modifications of\\n\\tthe search strategies are even less likely to be accomplished without\\n\\trewriting. Another symptom is no one knows how to make a general\\n\\tdatabase of commonsense knowledge that could be used by any program\\n\\tthat needed the knowledge. Along with other information, such a database\\n\\twould contain what a robot would need to know about the effects of\\n\\tmoving objects around, what a person can be expected to know about\\n\\this family, and the facts about buying and selling. This does not\\n\\tdepend on whether the knowledge is to be expressed in a logical language\\n\\tor in some other formalism. When we take the logic approach to AI,\\n\\tlack of generality shows up in that the axioms we devise to express\\n\\tcommonsense knowledge are too restricted in their applicability for\\n\\ta general commonsense database. In my opinion, getting a language\\n\\tfor expressing general commonsense knowledge for inclusion in a general\\n\\tdatabase is the key problem of generality in AI. Here are some ideas\\n\\tfor achieving generality proposed both before and after 1971. I repeat\\n\\tmy disclaimer of comprehensiveness.',\n",

Compelling data reveal a discouraging truth about growth today. There has been a marked decline in the ability of traditional levers of production---capital investment and labor---to propel economic growth. Yet, the numbers tell only part of the story. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new factor of production and has the potential to introduce new sources of growth, changing how work is done and reinforcing the role of people to drive growth in business. Accenture research on the impact of AI in 12 developed economies reveals that AI could double annual economic growth rates in 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. The impact of AI technologies on business is projected to increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent and enable people to make more efficient use of their time.',\n",

Such applications require AI methods to be robust to both the known unknowns (those uncertain aspects of the world about which the computer can reason explicitly) and the unknown unknowns (those aspects of the world that are not captured by the system's models). This article discusses recent progress in AI and then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and unknown unknowns. These issues are fascinating, because they touch on the fundamental question of how finite systems can survive and thrive in a complex and dangerous world\",\n",

Uncertainty has been studied in probability theory and graphical models, and relations have been studied in logic, in particular in the predicate calculus and its extensions. This book examines the foundations of combining logic and probability into what are called relational probabilistic models. It introduces representations, inference, and learning techniques for probability, logic, and their combinations. The book focuses on two representations in detail: Markov logic networks, a relational extension of undirected graphical models and weighted first-order predicate calculus formula, and Problog, a probabilistic extension of logic programs that can also be viewed as a Turing-complete relational extension of Bayesian networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'On behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, DIN and DKE started work on the second edition of the German Standardization Roadmap Artificial Intelligence in January 2022. With the broad participation and involvement of more than 570 experts from industry, science, the public sector and civil society, the strategic Roadmap for AI standardization was thus further developed. This work was coordinated and accompanied by a high-level coordination group for AI standardization and conformity \\r\\n\\r\\nThe standardization roadmap implements a measure of the German government’s AI Strategy and thus makes a significant contribution to “AI – Made in Germany”. \\r\\n\\r\\nStandardization is part of the AI Strategy and is a strategic instrument for strengthening the innovation and competitiveness of the German and European economies. Not least for this reason, standardization plays a special role in the planned European legal framework for AI, the Artificial Intelligence Act. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis Standardization Roadmap AI identifies the requirements in standardization, formulates concrete recommendations and thus creates the basis for initiating standardization work at national level, and especially at European and international level, at an early stage. In doing so, the Roadmap makes a significant contribution to the European Commission’s Artificial Intelligence Act, supporting its implementation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Standardization Roadmap AI focuses on nine key topics, which are addressed in Chapter 4: \\r\\n\\r\\n→ The Roadmap begins with the basic topics, such as terminologies and definitions, classifications and ethical issues. They are the basis for AI discussions and are thus the central core of the Roadmap.\\r\\n\\r\\n→ The security/safety of AI systems plays a crucial role in widespread use of AI solutions. Only a more in-depth consideration of requirements for operational safety and information security, for example, can enable the comprehensive use of AI systems in business and society.\\r\\n\\r\\n→ Another key topic, and the basis for the broad market success of AI, is testing and certification. This requires reliable quality criteria and reproducible test methods that can be used to verify the properties of AI systems. They are a key prerequisite for assessing the quality of AI-based applications and contribute significantly to explainability and traceability – two factors that build trust and acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\n→ Another challenge in the use of AI, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, is the integration of AI technologies in organizations. The focus here is on sociotechnical aspects such as human-technology interaction, humane work design, and requirements for business structures and processes, which are all examined in the Roadmap. \\r\\n\\r\\n→ The fields of application of AI are extremely diverse. AI technologies are used in almost all business and application areas and offer great potential. To cover a broad spectrum of applications, the Roadmap considers industry-specific challenges for the following five sectors in particular, in addition to the cross-cutting issues mentioned above: Industrial Automation, Mobility, Medicine, Financial Services and Energy / Environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe present Roadmap outlines the work and discussion results for all nine key topics and provides a comprehensive overview of the status quo, requirements, and needs for action.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper aims at filling some gaps in the mainstream debate on automation, the introduction of new technologies at the workplace and the future of work. This debate has concentrated, so far, on how many jobs will be lost as a consequence of technological innovation. This paper examines instead issues related to the quality of jobs in future labour markets. It addresses the detrimental effects on workers of awarding legal capacity and rights and obligation to robots. It examines the implications of practices such as People Analytics and the use of big data and artificial intelligence to manage the workforce. It stresses on an oft-neglected feature of the contract of employment, namely the fact that it vests the employer with authority and managerial prerogatives over workers. It points out that a vital function of labour law is to limit these authority and prerogatives to protect the human dignity of workers. In light of this, it argues that even if a Universal Basic Income were introduced, the existence of managerial prerogatives would still warrant the existence of labour regulation since this regulation is about much more than protecting workers’ income. It then highlights the benefits of human-rights based approaches to labour regulation to protect workers’ privacy against invasive electronic monitoring. It concludes by highlighting the crucial role of collective regulation and social partners in governing automation and the impact of technology at the workplace. It stresses that collective dismissal regulation and the involvement of workers’ representatives in managing and preventing job losses is crucial and that collective actors should actively participate in the governance of technology-enhanced management systems, to ensure a vital “human-in-command” approach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'SummaryObjectiveFormalizing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for a subsequent computer-supported processing is a challenging, but burdensome and time-consuming task. Existing methods and tools to support this task demand detailed medical knowledge, knowledge about the formal representations, and a manual modeling. Furthermore, formalized guideline documents mostly fall far short in terms of readability and understandability for the human domain modeler.Methods and materialWe propose a new multi-step approach using information extraction methods to support the human modeler by both automating parts of the modeling process and making the modeling process traceable and comprehensible. This paper addresses the first steps to obtain a representation containing processes which is independent of the final guideline representation language.ResultsWe have developed and evaluated several heuristics without the need to apply natural language understanding and implemented them in a framework to apply them to several guidelines from the medical subject of otolaryngology. Findings in the evaluation indicate that using semi-automatic, step-wise information extraction methods are a valuable instrument to formalize CPGs.ConclusionOur evaluation shows that a heuristic-based approach can achieve good results, especially for guidelines with a major portion of semi-structured text. It can be applied to guidelines irrespective to the final guideline representation format.',\n",

The paper is a conceptual piece based on an exploratory literature review, targeting librarians interested in AI from a strategic rather than a technical perspective. Five distinct types of use cases of AI are identified for libraries, each with its own underlying drivers and barriers, and skills demands. They are applications in library back-end processes, in library services, through the creation of communities of data scientists, in data and AI literacy and in user management. Each of the different applications has its own drivers and barriers. It is hard to anticipate the impact on professional work but as information environment becomes more complex it is likely that librarians will continue to have a very important role, especially given AI’s dependence on data. However, there could be some negative impacts on equality, diversity and inclusion if AI skills are not spread widely.',\n",

The co-word analysis of this sample suggests that AI is a field characterized by relative intellectual coherence in a specifiable `core'.

The problem is examined initially for the univariate case, and is extended to include additional meteorological parameters in the process of estimating the optimum model. The results indicate that the developed artificial intelligence models predict the solar radiation time series more effectively compared to the conventional procedures based on the clearness index.

       "  'abstract': 'AI or artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. As a result, Artificial Intelligence is gaining Importance in science and engineering fields. The use of Artificial Intelligence in medical diagnosis too is becoming increasingly common and has been used widely in the diagnosis of cancers, tumors, hepatitis, lung diseases, etc... The main aim of this paper is to build an Artificial Intelligent System that after analysis of certain parameters can predict that whether a person is diabetic or not. Diabetes is the name used to describe a metabolic condition of having higher than normal blood sugar levels. Diabetes is becoming increasingly more common throughout the world, due to increased obesity - which can lead to metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes leading to higher incidences of type 2 diabetes. Authors have identified 10 parameters that play an important role in diabetes and prepared a rich database of training data which served as the backbone of the prediction algorithm. Keeping in view this training data authors developed a system that uses the artificial neural networks algorithm to serve the purpose. These are capable of predicting new observations (on specific variables) from previous observations (on the same or other variables) after executing a process of so-called learning from existing training data (Haykin 1998).The results indicate that the performance of KNN method when compared with the medical diagnosis system was found to be 91%. This system can be used to assist medical programs especially in geographically remote areas where expert human diagnosis not possible with an advantage of minimal expenses and faster results.

       "  'abstract': \"In April 2021, the European Commission published its first draft of the Proposal for a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence. Since AI in the work context has increasingly become important in organising work and managing workers, the AI Act will undoubtedly have an impact on EU and national labour law systems. One aim of the proposal is to guarantee ‘consistency with existing Union legislation applicable to sectors where high-risk Artificial Intelligence systems are already used or likely to be used in the near future’, which includes the EU social acquis. It could be argued that ensuring true consistency with EU law means guaranteeing that the way the AI Act will be implemented and applied will still allow the other pieces of EU labour law to fulfil their purpose. It is undeniable that the implementation of the AI Act will overlap with various fields of EU law, especially considering the increasing use of AI technology at work. Thus, this article seeks to identify ways to refine the AI Act, insofar as it impacts work. The contribution discusses the current AI Act as proposed in April 2021, thereby focusing on two particular areas, EU non-discrimination law and EU law on occupational health and safety (OSH), as these two areas are, more or less explicitly, addressed as legal fields in the AI Act. The article starts with taking the perspective of EU labour law influencing the development of AI systems used in the employment context. We argue that providers should respect EU labour law throughout the development of the AI system (section 2). Then, the areas where EU labour law and the AI overlap are identified, thereby viewing it from an employer's perspective, i.e., the user of the AI system (section 3). Using two specific EU labour law areas (the right not to be discriminated against and the right to healthy and safe working conditions) the article provides a first assessment of how the AI Act might influence work and the regulation thereof (section 4). Finally, the conclusion critically explores whether and to what extent AI in employment situations warrants particular attention (section 5).\",\n",

Furthermore, EHRs are increasingly likely to\\r\\ninclude data relating to patient outcomes, functionality such as clinical\\r\\ndecision support, and genetic information as well, and, as such, can be seen as\\r\\nrepositories of increasingly valuable information about patients\\' health\\r\\nconditions and responses to treatment over time. Methods: We describe a case\\r\\nstudy of 423 patients treated by Centerstone within Tennessee and Indiana in\\r\\nwhich we utilized electronic health record data to generate predictive\\r\\nalgorithms of individual patient treatment response. Multiple models were\\r\\nconstructed using predictor variables derived from clinical, financial and\\r\\ngeographic data. Results: For the 423 patients, 101 deteriorated, 223 improved\\r\\nand in 99 there was no change in clinical condition. Based on modeling of\\r\\nvarious clinical indicators at baseline, the highest accuracy in predicting\\r\\nindividual patient response ranged from 70-72% within the models tested. In\\r\\nterms of individual predictors, the Centerstone Assessment of Recovery Level -\\r\\nAdult (CARLA) baseline score was most significant in predicting outcome over\\r\\ntime (odds ratio 4.1 + 2.27). Other variables with consistently significant\\r\\nimpact on outcome included payer, diagnostic category, location and provision\\r\\nof case management services. Conclusions: This approach represents a promising\\r\\navenue toward reducing the current gap between research and practice across\\r\\nhealthcare, developing data-driven clinical decision support based on\\r\\nreal-world populations, and serving as a component of embedded clinical\\r\\nartificial intelligences that \"learn\" over time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The general purpose of this research is to investigate the possibilities offered for the use of Artificial Intelligence theory and methods in advanced game environments. The real-time strategy (RTS) game genre is investigated in detail, and an architecture and solutions to some common issues are presented. An RTS AI controlled opponent named \"KAI\" is implemented for the \"TA Spring\" game engine in order to advance the state of the art in usin AI techniques in games and to gain some insight into the strengths and weaknesses of AI Controlled Player (AI CP) architectures.A goal was to create an AI with behavior that gave the impression of intelligence to the human player, by taking on certain aspects of the style in which human players play the game. Another goal for the benefit of the TA Spring development community was to create an AI which played with sufficient skill to provide experienced players with resistance, without using obvious means of cheating such as getting free resources or military assets.Several common techniques were used, among others Rule-based decision making, path planning and path replanning, influence maps, and a variant of the A* search algorithm was used for searches of various kinds. The AI also has an approach to micromanagement of units that are fighting in combination with influence maps. The AI CP program was repeatedly tested against human players and other AI CP programs in various settings throughout development. The availability of testing by the community but the sometimes sketchy feedback lead to the production of consistent behavior for tester and developer alike in order to progress. One obstacle that was met was that the rule-based approach to combat behavior resulted in high complexity.The architecture of the RTS AI CP is designed to emerge a strategy from separate agents that were situation aware. Both the actions of the enemy and the properties of the environment are taken into account. The overall approach is to strengthen the AI CP through better economic and military decisions. Micromanagement and frequent updates for moving units is an important part of improving military decisions in this architecture.This thesis goes into the topics of RTS strategies, tactics, economic decisions and military decisions and how they may be made by AI in an informed way. Direct attempts at calculation and prediction rather than having the AI learn from experience resulted in behavior that was superior to most AI CPs and many human players without a learning period. However, having support for all of the game types for TA Spring resulted in extra development time.',\n",

However, one of the book's shortcomings is that it uses POP-11, an obscure Lisp-like programming language, to create the example programs. To read the example programs, you will first have to slog through a tutorial on POP-11 and, because you will probably not have a POP-11 compiler, you will not be able to try out the examples. The bulk of the book is dedicated to describing standard artificial intelligence topics, such as search and knowledge representation. <I>Computers and Thought </I>provides a unified, self-contained introduction to artificial intelligence for readers with little or no computing background. It presents an original extended AI programming project - the Automated Tourist Guide exercise throughout the main chapters of the text to illustrate the material covered and show how AI actually works.<br /> <br /> Most chapters illustrate a particular AI topic, with sections on the background to the topic, methods, applications, and the limitations of previous proposals. In addition, there are end of chapter summaries and graded exercises, suggested readings, a glossary, and an appendix on programming.<br /> <br /> <I>Computers and Thought </I>details the theory and issues involved in AI and covers computer simulation of human activities, such as problem solving and natural language understanding, and computer vision. Its investigation of AI is usefully extended to models of cognition, the nature of mind and intelligence, and the social implications of AI and cognitive science.<br /> <br /> The computer language is POP-11, an easy to learn language that can be used interactively, like LISP, and that has an appearance similar to PASCAL. It is not necessary to run the illustrative POP-11 programs on a computer, since a feature of the language is the ease with which it can be understood from the printed page.<br /> <br /> Mike Sharples, David Hogg, Chris Hutchison, Steve Torrance, and David Young have all been faculty members at The School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, Sussex University, Brighton, England <I>Computers and Thought </I> is included in the series Explorations in Cognitive Science, edited by Margaret A Boden.

What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Coronavirus has quickly spread to more than 200 nations, infecting several million people globally in a matter of weeks. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have been shown to be beneficial in testing, diagnosing, and efficiently limiting viral propagation. However, several flaws or limitations have been discovered in existing AI approaches. Patients are diagnosed after the onset of symptoms, making it difficult to determine the appropriate patient management. Doctors' involvement is required, which may result in viral infection via direct contact with patients. The present project attempts to create AI approaches to address such issues. This work suggests AI capable of estimating the timing of viral infection in patients and the degree of medical treatment required prior to the development of COVID-19 symptoms. Many vital biological and human functions are measured by the proposed device, including the state of the brain and neurotransmitters, mental/mood conditions, tension level of face muscles, hands, and body temperature, rate of pulse and pressure, oxygen level in the blood, rate of breathing and difficulty, degree of redness of eye(s), and general body imbalances. This work makes use of both hardware and software designs. To explore, test, and evaluate the integration/work of each subsystem component and the overall system architecture, an experimental research is used. The findings demonstrated that the suggested approach might be utilised to differentiate between healthy and infected persons prior to the manifestation of COVID-19 symptoms.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Introduction begins by providing examples of the fields in which AI is used, along with the varying impact that this has on society. It focuses on the challenges that AI poses when it comes to setting and applying law, particularly in relation to legal rules that seek to preserve the opportunities associated with AI while avoiding or at least minimising the potential risks. The law must aim to ensure good digital governance, both with respect to the development of algorithmic systems generally but also with respect to the use of AI specifically. Particularly formidable are the challenges associated with regulating the use of learning algorithms, such as in the case of machine learning. A great difficulty in this regard is ensuring transparency, accountability, responsibility, and the ability to make revisions, as well as preventing hidden discrimination. The Chapter explores the types of rules and regulations that are available. At the same time, it emphasises that it is not enough to trust that companies that use AI will adhere to ethical principles. Rather, supplementary legal rules are indispensable, including in the areas examined in the Chapter, which are mainly characterised by company self-regulation. The Chapter concludes by stressing the need for transnational agreements and institutions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Several governments recently adopted strategies to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence (AI), one of the reasons being the pursuit of sustainability – a claim with little scientific grounding so far. In this thesis, I strived to outline the scope of AI’s potentials by showing i) the limits of its theoretical and practical usefulness and ii) the political barriers to using it for sustainability.\\r\\nThrough the method of immanent critique, I demonstrated that AI shares most of its theoretical limitations with statistical methods in general and concluded that it is best suited for the narrowly defined area of closed, formal systems with low decision stakes. To assess AI’s practical potentials, I conducted a systematic literature review searching for AI use cases that contribute to the indicators of the German sustainability strategy. The resulting use cases mostly described how AI increased efficiencies or generated empirical knowledge, yet they only marginally addressed the major obstacles to sustainability identified by the government.\\r\\nSince technological possibilities do not linearly translate to real-world adoption, I turned to the realm of politics to unveil dominant discourses that may shape the goals and areas of AI’s use in society. As an exemplary space of AI’s discursive mediation, I examined the German government’s national AI strategy using critical discourse analysis. It resulted that the government prioritized discourses of competitiveness and technological determinism over sustainability considerations. Tensions between different interest groups were linguistically concealed, while competition and technological progress were invoked as external threats to be faced in consensus. This strategy of depoliticization legitimizes and naturalizes current power relations to the advantage of certain actors. The revealed primacy of market logics further reduced the likeliness of realizing AI’s limited sustainability potentials. Yet, alternative ways to govern AI exist and allow overcoming the constructed necessity of neoliberal politics.',\n",

Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Different machine learning algorithms were trained and validated to detect cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury within 12 hours after surgery. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, preoperative cardiac status, intra- and postoperative variables including creatinine and hemoglobin values were retrieved for analysis. \\r\\n\\r\\nResults: From 7507 patients analyzed, 1699 patients (22.6 %) developed cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury. The ultimate detection model, 'Detect-A(K)I', recognizes cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury within 12 hours with an area under the curve of 88.0 %, sensitivity of 78.0 %, specificity of 78.9 %, and accuracy of 82.1 %. The optimal parameter set includes serial changes of creatinine and hemoglobin, operative emergency, bleeding-associated variables, cardiac ischemic time and cardiac function-associated variables, age, diuretics and active infection, chronic obstructive lung and peripheral vascular disease.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: The 'Detect-A(K)I' model successfully detects cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury within 12 hours after surgery with the best discriminatory characteristics reported so far.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The work in this paper is directed towards sophisticated formalisms for reasoning under probabilistic uncertainty in ontologies in the Semantic Web. Ontologies play a central role in the development of the Semantic Web, since they provide a precise definition of shared terms in web resources. They are expressed in the standardized web ontology language OWL, which consists of the three increasingly expressive sublanguages OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. The sublanguages OWL Lite and OWL DL have a formal semantics and a reasoning support through a mapping to the expressive description logics and , respectively. In this paper, we present the expressive probabilistic description logics P- and P-, which are probabilistic extensions of these description logics. They allow for expressing rich terminological probabilistic knowledge about concepts and roles as well as assertional probabilistic knowledge about instances of concepts and roles. They are semantically based on the notion of probabilistic lexicographic entailment from probabilistic default reasoning, which naturally interprets this terminological and assertional probabilistic knowledge as knowledge about random and concrete instances, respectively. As an important additional feature, they also allow for expressing terminological default knowledge, which is semantically interpreted as in Lehmann's lexicographic entailment in default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. Another important feature of this extension of and by probabilistic uncertainty is that it can be applied to other classical description logics as well. We then present sound and complete algorithms for the main reasoning problems in the new probabilistic description logics, which are based on reductions to reasoning in their classical counterparts, and to solving linear optimization problems. In particular, this shows the important result that reasoning in the new probabilistic description logics is decidable/computable. Furthermore, we also analyze the computational complexity of the main reasoning problems in the new probabilistic description logics in the general as well as restricted cases.\",\n",

The verification of properties of the GL (e.g., the verification of GL correctness with respect to several criteria) is a demanding task, which may be enhanced through the adoption of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques. In this paper, we propose a general and flexible approach to address such a task.Methods and materialsOur approach to GL verification is based on the integration of a computerized GL management system with a model-checker. We propose a general methodology, and we instantiate it by loosely coupling GLARE, our system for acquiring, representing and executing GLs, with the model-checker SPIN.ResultsWe have carried out an in-depth analysis of the types of properties that can be effectively verified using our approach, and we have completed an overview of the usefulness of the verification task at the different stages of the GL life-cycle. In particular, experimentation on a GL for ischemic stroke has shown that the automatic verification of properties in the model checking approach is able to discover inconsistencies in the GL that cannot be detected in advance by hand.ConclusionOur approach thus represents a further step in the direction of general and flexible automated GL verification, which also meets usability requirements.',\n",

As a result, GroupDNet has a lot of influence over converting natural images with semantic marks and can produce high quality outcomes that are feasible for containing a lot of groups.

Based primarily on an Artificial Intelligence - Tutoring Subsystem, used to identify, monitor and adapt the student\\'s learning path, considering the students actual knowledge, learning habits and preferred learning style. The proposed concept has the peculiarity of eliminating any didactical boundaries or rigid, implied course structures (also known as unlimited didactical freedom). Relying on \"real time\" adapted profiles, it allows content authors to apply a dynamic course design, supporting tutored, collaborative sessions and activities, as suggested by modern pedagogy. The AI tutoring facility (eTutor), coupled with the LMS, is intended to support the \"human tutor\" with valuable LE performance - / activity data, available from the integrated \"Behavior Recorder Controller\" (BRC), allowing to confirm or manually modify actions suggested by the eTutor. The student has the option to select the level of tutoring interventions or switch to a \"subject matter\" exercise mode if he feels, and is allowed to do so. The concept presented combines a personalized level of surveillance, learning activity- and/or learning path adaptation suggestions to ensure the students learning motivation and learning success.',\n",

Recently, a number of systems have been proposed for linking entity mentions in text to Wikipedia pages. Such systems typically search for candidate entities and then disambiguate them, returning either the best candidate or nil. However, comparison has focused on disambiguation accuracy, making it difficult to determine how search impacts performance. Furthermore, important approaches from the literature have not been systematically compared on standard data sets. We reimplement three seminal nel systems and present a detailed evaluation of search strategies. Our experiments find that coreference and acronym handling lead to substantial improvement, and search strategies account for much of the variation between systems. This is an interesting finding, because these aspects of the problem have often been neglected in the literature, which has focused largely on complex candidate ranking algorithms.',\n",

Many researchers have deplored the lack of precise semantics for such axioms, while others have argued that it might be best to compile them away. We propose an adequate semantics for pddl axioms and show that they are an essential feature by proving that it is impossible to compile them away if we restrict the growth of plans and domain descriptions to be polynomial.

As company grows a number of problem also arises first, a varieties of item are needed to be maintained in the inventory making it difficult to for managers to keep track, therefore a formal record keeping will have to evolve, besides that as quantities in inventory grows more space is required to do business. Due to local and global competition any company that must survive in the competitive world must take an advantage of effective management of its inventory seriously therefore the use of intelligent approach for effective and efficient inventory management system has become indispensable. This work developed an intelligent system implemented in a web based environment to integrate multiple stores also providing an effective coordination of all of the stores, intelligently determining the different reorder points of all the disparate stores in the systems and communicating the information back to the centralized store using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) with a secure socket layer (SSL), implemented using My Structured Query Language (MySQL), Database Management System, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript, Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and Xampp (Apache). The work optimized the performance of inventory management integrating multiple systems and providing an efficient coordination and monitoring moving away from single store into distributed system relating real time status of supplies at the different stores.

       "  'abstract': 'Most of the existing image recognitions systems are based on physical parameters of the images whereas image processing methodologies relies on extraction of color, shape and edge features. Thus Transfer Learning is an efficient approach of solving classification problem with little amount of data. There are many deep learning algorithms but most tested one is AlexNet. It is well known Convolution Neural Network AlexNet CNN for recognition of images using deep learning. So for recognition and detection of the image we have proposed Deep Learning approach in this project which can analyse thousands of images which may take a lot for a human to do. Pretrained convolutional neural network i.e. AlexNet is trained by using the features such as textures, colors and shape. The model is trained on more than 1000 images and can classify images into categories which we have defined. The trained model is tested on various standard and own recorded datasets consist of rotational, translated and shifted images. Thus when a image is passed to the system it will apply AlexNet and return the results with a image category in which the image lies with high accuracy. Thus our project tends to reduce time and cost of image recognition systems using deep learning. Dr. Sachin K. Korde | Manoj J. Munda | Yogesh B. Chintamani | Yasir L. Pirjade | Akshay V.

The expert system can serve as a potential tool for mass level screening of cervical cancer by characterization and classification of Papanicolaou smear images. The Expert system presented in this work is powered by a novel hierarchical probabilistic artificial neural network that works along with the knowledgebase of novel benchmark database of digitized cervical cells. The primary purpose of employing expert systems in medicine is creation of such artificially intelligent systems which can provide assistance to a medical doctor in delivering expert diagnosis. These artificial intelligent systems support the clinical decision making by anticipating the diagnostic results once they are trained using previously acquired training data. The use of Artificial intelligence in medicine has shown substantial progress in achieving timely, reliable diagnosis and more precise treatment of many diseases.The expert system developed in this work exhibited a competence of about 92% which has been evaluated by comparing its results with the identification & classification of cervical cells by human experts.

Previous research has attempted to use several class specific generators, which limits its application to datasets with a limited number of classes. Instead, we suggest a new Group Decreasing Network GroupDNet , which takes advantage in the generator of group convolutions and gradually reduces the percentages of the groups decoders convolutions. As a result, GroupDNet has a lot of influence over converting semantic labels to natural images and can produce plausible high quality results for datasets with a lot of groups. Experiments on a variety of difficult datasets show that GroupDNet outperforms other algorithms in the SMIS mission. We also demonstrate that GroupDNet can perform a variety of interesting synthesis tasks.

Using the case study of an AI‐enabled chatbot initially created by IBM and subsequently developed by an alt‐labour network in the United States and a traditional union in Australia, this article outlines several distinctive ways in which the chatbot increased union resources and capabilities. Once reconfigured to reflect an ‘organising’, rather than ‘servicing’ ethos, the chatbot became an infrastructural resource that enabled otherwise marginal workers to receive basic information in a manner that reinforced union narratives of power and worker solidarity, and workplaces to be mapped more efficiently. The chatbot did not act as a labour saving tool, but stimulated wide‐ranging learning by bringing implicit tensions between ‘servicing’ and ‘organising’ conceptions of knowledge, power and expertise to the surface. Chatbots thus offer distinctive potential affordances to unions in enhancing their resources and capabilities as ‘orchestrators’ of worker power.',\n",

With the widespread adoption of LLMs, human gold--standard annotations are key to understanding the capabilities of LLMs and the validity of their results. However, crowdsourcing, an important, inexpensive way to obtain human annotations, may itself be impacted by LLMs, as crowd workers have financial incentives to use LLMs to increase their productivity and income. To investigate this concern, we conducted a case study on the prevalence of LLM usage by crowd workers. We reran an abstract summarization task from the literature on Amazon Mechanical Turk and, through a combination of keystroke detection and synthetic text classification, estimate that 33-46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task. Although generalization to other, less LLM-friendly tasks is unclear, our results call for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human, perhaps using the methodology proposed here as a stepping stone.',\n",

The typical way that a FRS can be used for identification purposes. The effectiveness of the whole system is highly dependent on the quality and characteristics of the captured face image. The process begins with face detection and extraction from the larger image, which generally contains a background and often more complex patterns and even other faces.

They can possibly reform urban portability by giving maintainable, protected, and advantageous, clog free transportability. The issues like reliably perceiving traffic lights, signs, indistinct path markings can be overwhelmed by utilizing the innovative improvement in the fields of Deep Learning DL . Here, Faster Region Based Convolution Neural Network F RCNN is proposed for detection and recognition of Traffic Lights TL and signs by utilizing transfer learning. The input can be taken from the dataset containing various images of traffic signals and signs as per Indian Traffic Signals. The model achieves its target by distinguishing the traffic light and signs with its right class type. The proposed framework can likewise be upgraded for safe driving in spite of hazy path markings.

       "  'abstract': \"There has been widespread media commentary about the potential impact of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT on the Education field, but little examination at scale of how educators believe teaching and assessment should change as a result of generative AI. This mixed methods study examines the views of educators (nþinspace=þinspace318) from a diverse range of teaching levels, experience levels, discipline areas, and regions about the impact of AI on teaching and assessment, the ways that they believe teaching and assessment should change, and the key motivations for changing their practices. The majority of teachers felt that generative AI would have a major or profound impact on teaching and assessment, though a sizeable minority felt it would have a little or no impact. Teaching level, experience, discipline area, region, and gender all significantly influenced perceived impact of generative AI on teaching and assessment. Higher levels of awareness of generative AI predicted higher perceived impact, pointing to the possibility of an `ignorance effect'. Thematic analysis revealed the specific curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment changes that teachers feel are needed as a result of generative AI, which centre around learning with AI, higher-order thinking, ethical values, a focus on learning processes and face-to-face relational learning. Teachers were most motivated to change their teaching and assessment practices to increase the performance expectancy of their students and themselves. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings in a world with increasingly prevalent AI.\",\n",

The goal of Information Technology is to develop a device which is able to work like a human itself. For that Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are going to be used. Machine Learning is a subpart of the Artificial Intelligent which helps a machine to learn by itself. To apply learning processes on machines it required deep knowledge of programming, mathematics and statistics. Now it is not a big problem, as the technology is changing day by day the new concept known as No Code ML and Auto Code Generation are introduced. This helps the users to create a model without doing any kind of coding. In this new technology everyone is able to create a model and use machine learning. There are several platforms which provide this kind of facilities. The models created on those platforms give good accuracy and desire outcomes as well.

In this short paper, we provide a first user evaluation by 10 data scientists of an experimental system, AutoAIViz, that aims to visualize AutoAI's model generation process.

Most work has been performed to date to automate the identification of video facial expressions, audio spoken expressions, written text expressions, and physiology as measured by wearables. A real time recognition framework was built in this project that traces the very mood of the individual using some of the libraries such as Keras, OpenCV, Tensor flow, SciPy, The Python Alternative To Matlab, etc. HOF and SVM were used to tackle the problem of recognition. At each point, optical flows calculate the rotation between two frames relative to an observer. For image recognition, the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks were used.

       "  'abstract': 'Along with the development of the Internet, the emergence and widespread adoption of the social media concept have changed the way news is formed and published. News has become faster, less costly and easily accessible with social media. This change has come along with some disadvantages as well. In particular, beguiling content, such as fake news made by social media users, is becoming increasingly dangerous. The fake news problem, despite being introduced for the first time very recently, has become an important research topic due to the high content of social media. Writing fake comments and news on social media is easy for users. The main challenge is to determine the difference between real and fake news. In this paper, a two-step method for identifying fake news on social media has been proposed, focusing on fake news. In the first step of the method, a number of pre-processing is applied to the data set to convert un-structured data sets into the structured data set. The texts in the data set containing the news are represented by vectors using the obtained TF weighting method and Document-Term Matrix. In the second step, twenty-three supervised artificial intelligence algorithms have been implemented in the data set transformed into the structured format with the text mining methods. In this work, an experimental evaluation of the twenty-three intelligent classification methods has been performed within existing public data sets and these classification models have been compared depending on four evaluation metrics.',\n",

Despite the vast amount of research into MCTS, the effect of modifications on the algorithm, as well as the manner in which it performs in various domains, is still not yet fully known. In particular, the effect of using knowledge-heavy rollouts in MCTS still remains poorly understood, with surprising results demonstrating that better-informed rollouts often result in worse-performing agents. We present experimental evidence suggesting that, under certain smoothness conditions, uniformly random simulation policies preserve the ordering over action preferences. This explains the success of MCTS despite its common use of these rollouts to evaluate states. We further analyse non-uniformly random rollout policies and describe conditions under which they offer improved performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The objective of this study is to examine the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the security posture of financial institutions against malware attacks. The study identifies the current trends of malware attacks in the banking sector, assesses the various forms of malware and their impact on financial institutions, and analyzes the relevant security features of AI. The findings suggest that financial institutions must implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect against various forms of malware attacks, including ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, mobile malware attacks, APTs, and insider threats. The study recommends that financial institutions invest in AI-based security systems to improve security features and automate security tasks. To ensure the reliability and security of AI systems, it is essential to incorporate relevant security features such as explain ability, privacy, anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and data validation. The study highlights the importance of incorporating explainable AI (XAI) to enable users to understand the reasoning behind the AI's decisions and actions, identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities in the AI system, and ensure that the system operates ethically and transparently. The study also recommends incorporating privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) into AI systems to protect user data from unauthorized access and use. Finally, the study recommends incorporating robust security measures such as anomaly detection and intrusion detection to protect against adversarial attacks and data validation and integrity checks to protect against data poisoning attacks. Overall, this study provides insights for decision-makers in implementing effective cybersecurity strategies to protect financial institutions from malware attacks.\",\n",

This assumption makes it possible to recover the structure of any group of two or more rigidly connected points. The structure of jointed objects is recovered by analyzing them as collections of rigid parts, and then unifying the structures proposed for the parts.

       "  'abstract': 'Electronic mail is a major revolution taking place over traditional communication systems due to its convenient, economical, fast, and easy to use nature. A major bottleneck in electronic communications is the enormous dissemination of unwanted, harmful emails known as spam emails . A major concern is the developing of suitable filters that can adequately capture those emails and achieve high performance rate. Machine learning (ML) researchers have developed many approaches in order to tackle this problem. Within the context of machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) have made a large contribution to the development of spam email filtering. Based on SVM, different schemes have been proposed through text classification approaches (TC). A crucial problem when using SVM is the choice of kernels as they directly affect the separation of emails in the feature space. This paper presents thorough investigation of several distance-based kernels and specify spam filtering behaviors using SVM. The majority of used kernels in recent studies concern continuous data and neglect the structure of the text. In contrast to classical kernels, we propose the use of various string kernels for spam filtering. We show how effectively string kernels suit spam filtering problem. On the other hand, data preprocessing is a vital part of text classification where the objective is to generate feature vectors usable by SVM kernels. We detail a feature mapping variants in TC that yield improved performance for the standard SVM in filtering task. Furthermore, to cope for realtime scenarios we propose an online active framework for spam filtering. We present empirical results from an extensive study of online, transductive, and online active methods for classifying spam emails in real time. We show that active online method using string kernels achieves higher precision and recall rates.',\n",

The reasons for such gaps are complex and include the social and material poverty of some learners with their resulting other deficits, as well as failure by government to allocate sufficient resources to remedy the situation. On the supply side of the equation, a single teacher or university lecturer, even helped by a classroom assistant or tutorial assistant, cannot give each learner the kind of one-to-one attention that would really help to boost both their motivation and their attainment in ways that might mitigate the achievement gap.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this chapter Benedict du Boulay, Alexandra Poulovassilis, Wayne Holmes, and Manolis Mavrikis argue that we now have the technologies to assist both educators and learners, most commonly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects (STEM), at least some of the time.

A branch and bound algorithm based on the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland procedure (DPLL) is one of the most competitive exact algorithms for solving max-SAT. In this paper, we propose and investigate a number of strategies for max-SAT. The first strategy is a set of unit propagation or unit resolution rules for max-SAT. We summarize three existing unit propagation rules and propose a new one based on a nonlinear programming formulation of max-SAT. The second strategy is an effective lower bound based on linear programming (LP). We show that the LP lower bound can be made effective as the number of clauses increases. The third strategy consists of a binary-clause first rule and a dynamic-weighting variable ordering rule, which are motivated by a thorough analysis of two existing well-known variable orderings. Based on the analysis of these strategies, we develop an exact solver for both max-SAT and weighted max-SAT. Our experimental results on random problem instances and many instances from the max-SAT libraries show that our new solver outperforms most of the existing exact max-SAT solvers, with orders of magnitude of improvement in many cases.',\n",

The second, relatively\\n                 unique approach, infers rules from a data set by using\\n                 the paradigm of genetic programming. The rules consist\\n                 of an IF-part (antecedent) and a THEN-part\\n                 (consequent). The system has to be supplied with the\\n                 consequent and works out antecedents, which describe\\n                 the sub data set indicated by the consequent within the\\n                 supplied data set. The antecedents produced take the\\n                 form of a tree where Boolean operations AND, OR and NOT\\n                 represent nodes, and Boolean expressions represent the\\n                 leaves. Boolean expressions can be built from all types\\n                 of data including free-text and real numbers. This\\n                 system was also implemented with Java and offers in\\n                 addition the possibility of knowledge extraction from\\n                 clusters built by the self-organizing map approach.\",\n",

Deep Learning algorithms are commonly used in healthcare, facial and voice recognition, defense, security and autonomous vehicles. Image processing is one of the most common applications of Deep Learning. Deep Learning software is commonly used to capture and process images by removing the errors.

       "  'abstract': 'Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.',\n",

Systems that are able to detect contradictions, identify their causes, or readjust their knowledge bases to remove the contradiction, called Belief Revision Systems, Truth Maintenance Systems, or Reason Maintenance Systems, have been studied by several researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present a logic suitable for supporting belief revision systems, discuss the properties that a belief revision system based on this logic will exhibit, and present a particular implementation of our model of a belief revision system. The system we present differs from most of the systems developed so far in three respects: First, it is based on a logic that was developed to support belief revision systems. Second, it uses the rules of inference of the logic to automatically compute the dependencies among propositions rather than having to force the user to do this, as in many existing systems. Third, it was the first belief revision system whose implementation relies on the manipulation of sets of assumptions, not justifications.',\n",

Recent experience with DLs, however, has shown that their expressivity is often insufficient to accurately describe structured objects--objects whose parts are interconnected in arbitrary, rather than tree-like ways. DL knowledge bases describing structured objects are therefore usually underconstrained, which precludes the entailment of certain consequences and causes performance problems during reasoning.\\r\\nTo address this problem, we propose an extension of DL languages with description graphs--a knowledge modeling construct that can accurately describe objects with parts connected in arbitrary ways. Furthermore, to enable modeling the conditional aspects of structured objects, we also extend DLs with rules. We present an in-depth study of the computational properties of such a formalism. In particular, we first identify the sources of undecidability of the general, unrestricted formalism. Based on that analysis, we then investigate several restrictions of the general formalism that make reasoning decidable. We present practical evidence that such a logic can be used to model nontrivial structured objects. Finally, we present a practical decision procedure for our formalism, as well as tight complexity bounds.',\n",

Such guidelines are used in the manual processes of (a) adapting existing documents and (b) producing new materials. The process of adapting existing documents is cyclic and implies three activities: analysis, transformation, and validation.

In order to alleviate such processes, we are currently investigating the development of methods, based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, to perform the analysis and transformation of documents in a (semi)-automatic fashion. In this paper we present our AI-based method for assessing a particular document with respect to the E2R guidelines as well as an initial implementation of such a method; our research on the transformation of documents is out of the scope of this paper.

       "  'abstract': 'Face recognition across age progression is remains one of the areas most challenging tasks now a days, as the aging process affects both the shape and texture of a face. One possible solution is to apply a probabilistic model to represent a face simultaneously with its identity variable, which is stable through time, and its aging variable, which changes with time. This paper proposes a deep learning and set based approach to the face recognition subject to aging. The images for each subject taken at various times are treated as a single set, which is then compared to the sets of images belonging to other subjects. Facial features are extracted using a convolutional neural network characteristic of the deep learning. Our experimental results show that set based recognition performs better than the singleton based approach for the both face identification and face verification. We also find that by using set based recognition, it is easier to recognize older subjects from younger ones rather than younger subjects from older ones.

Wherever\\n\\tappropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of\\n\\tthe literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful\\n\\theuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe adjective \"heuristic,\" as used here and widely in the literature,\\n\\tmeans related to improving problem-solving performance; as a noun\\n\\tit is also used in regard to any method or trick used to improve\\n\\tthe efficiency of a problem-solving system. A \"heuristic program,\"\\n\\tto be considered successful, must work well on a variety of problems,\\n\\tand may often be excused if it fails on some. We often find it worthwhile\\n\\tto introduce a heuristic method, which happens to cause occasional\\n\\tfailures, if there is an over-all improvement in performance.

       "  'abstract': 'Fuzzy logic is a method to formalize the human capacity of imprecise reasoning. Fuzzy logic react how people think. It tries to make our sense of words and our decision making. As a result  it is making to human intelligent systems. There are three basic steps for fuzzy logic system i.e. Fuzzification  Rule evaluation and Defuzzification. In this paper I discuss a real life problem in which different results of same survey were presented. The survey data represent vague values in the form of fuzzy sets. To solve this problem we applied defuzzification methods to get the best result from surveys. I represent the most commonly used defuzzification methods and made comparison to choose the best one.

       "  'abstract': 'The astonishing growth of the Internet is the first sign that every aspect of our economy and society are likely to change. Yet for people to realize the vast promise of networked computing, Internet applications must become dramatically more powerful and easier to use. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology holds the key to these futuristic applications with the promise of advanced features, adaptive functionality and intuitive interfaces. We group Internet applications into four categories: 1) user modeling, 2) discovery and analysis of remote information sources, 3) information integration, and 4) web-site management. The seven papers in this special issue represent some of the latest and most exciting research in three of the four categories. This introduction attempts to place the special-issue papers in context, but we caution readers that the field is too young and moving too quickly for a comprehensive survey article.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper, we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update.\",\n",

Given vast amount of data, one of the challenge has been to automatically identify the topic of the background chatter. Such emerging topics can be identified by the appearance of multiple posts on a unique subject matter, which is distinct from previous online discourse. We address the problem of identifying topics through the use of machine learning. I propose a topic detection method based on supervised machine learning model, where sentences are labelled, tokenized and the vectorised sentence is trained on densely connected neural network. Compared to conventional gradient descent optimization algorithm, Adam optimizer trains the data much faster and efficiently. Finally the model is tested on an Android App with live data from Google News.

They consist of visual pattern understanding problems on which the task of the pattern perceiver is to find an abstract aspect of distinction between two classes of figures. This paper examines the philosophical question of whether objects in Bongard problems can be ascribed an a priori, metaphysical, existence—the ontological question of whether objects, and their boundaries, come pre-defined, independently of any understanding or context. This is an essential issue, because it determines whether a priori symbolic representations can be of use for solving Bongard problems. The resulting conclusion of this analysis is that in the case of Bongard problems there can be no units ascribed an a priori existence—and thus the objects dealt with in any specific problem must be found by solution methods (rather than given to them). This view ultimately leads to the emerging alternatives to the philosophical doctrine of metaphysical realism.',\n",

In this paper, this general problem is briefly analysed for broadband conditions. The viability of application in this field of an artificial intelligence technique supported on the modelling of the transducer internal components is studied. A genetic algorithm (GA) procedure is presented and applied to the estimation of different parameters, related to two transducers which are working as pulsed transmitters.

Theoretically, combining logic and probability in a unified representation and building general-purpose reasoning tools for it has been the dream of AI, dating back to the late 1980s. Practically, successful statistical relational AI tools enable new applications in several large, complex real-world domains including those involving big data, natural text, social networks, the web, medicine and robotics, among others. Such domains are often characterized by rich relational structure and large amounts of uncertainty. Logic helps to faithfully model the former while probability helps to effectively manage the latter. Our intention here is to give a brief (and necessarily incomplete) overview and invitation to the emerging field of Statistical Relational AI from the perspective of acting optimally and learning to act.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"This paper argues that the AI ethics has generally neglected the issues related to the science communication of AI. In particular, the article focuses on visual communication about AI and, more specifically, on the use of certain stock images in science communication about AI --- in particular, those characterized by an excessive use of blue color and recurrent subjects, such as androgyne faces, half-flesh and half-circuit brains, and variations on Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. In the first section, the author refers to a ``referentialist'' ethics of science communication for an ethical assessment of these images. From this perspective, these images are unethical. While the ethics of science communication generally promotes virtues like modesty and humility, similar images are arrogant and overconfident. In the second section, the author uses French philosopher Jacques Rancière's concepts of ``distribution of the sensible,'' ``disagreement,'' and ``pensive image.'' Rancière's thought paves the way to a deeper critique of these images of AI. The problem with similar images is not their lack of reference to the ``things themselves.'' It rather lies in the way they stifle any possible forms of disagreement about AI. However, the author argues that stock images and other popular images of AI are not a problem per se, and they can also be a resource. This depends on the real possibility for these images to support forms of pensiveness. In the conclusion, the question is asked whether the kind of ethics or politics of AI images proposed in this article can be applied to AI ethics tout court.\",\n",

In the study the sentiment analysis of the reviews of drugs given by the patients after the usage using the boosting algorithms in machine learning. The Dataset used, provides patient reviews on some specific drugs along with the conditions the patient is suffering from and a 10 star patient rating reflecting the patient satisfaction. Exploratory Data Analysis is carried out to get more insight and engineer features. Preprocessing is done to get the data ready. The sentiment of the review is given according to the rating of the drugs. To classify the reviews as positive or negative three Classification models are trained LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost and the feature importance is plotted. The result shows that LGBM is the best performing Boosting algorithm with an accuracy of 88.89 .

However, knowledge gained in this field has greatly enhanced our understanding and has enabled us to design human-like intelligent systems. In the 1920s the Gestalt psychologists introduced a new field to cognitive science. They discovered that when presented with certain problems we use insight to reach a solution. In the 1950s Newell and Simon then brought the field of problem solving into the information age. They experimented with the idea of problem solving as a search for a solution in a state space. This technique is today utilized in the field of computing and Artificial Intelligence. This paper reviews techniques and looks at how we use previous experience gained by solving problems to solve new similar problems, making analogies between them. Experts' performance during problem solving is compared to that of novices.\",\n",

What areas are progressing, and at what pace? What are the successes and the challenges? Will AI improve our lives? For example, will it increase productivity, open up new business opportunities, lengthen life expectancy and improve its quality? Or is AI a threat to society? For example, will it eliminate jobs, accentuate biases, or lead to unfair concentration of knowledge and wealth? Many people are chiming in on these questions. Opinions diverge, which is to be expected in a fast-moving area with more unknowns than knowns. It is an important conversation to have. And precisely because of the inherent uncertainty, it's important that the conversation be anchored in fact. It's hard enough for AI practitioners to keep track of everything that's going on in our exploding field and make sense of it, and it's all the more daunting to outsiders.

These differences led to different priorities, methods, and assessment approaches. A consequence was competition for resources, with HCI flourishing in AI winters and moving more slowly when AI was in favor.

In Zukunft werden kontextadaptive Verfahren notwendig werden, die eine Verknüpfung zwischen statistischen Lernmethoden und großen Wissensrepräsentationen (Ontologien) herstellen und Nachvollziehbarkeit, Verständlichkeit und Erklärbarkeit erlauben -- dem Ziel von ,,explainable AI``.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Artificial Intelligence AI has become an integral part of our post COVID world, influencing various aspects of our lives, from healthcare to remote work and education. While AI offers numerous advantages, it also poses significant risks, including ethical dilemmas, bias, privacy concerns, and potential job displacement. This abstract explores the evolving landscape of AI safety and regulations in the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic. AI safety encompasses efforts to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, preventing unintended consequences and safeguarding individuals and society at large. In parallel, AI regulations aim to establish a framework that guides the ethical and accountable use of AI technologies. These regulations address data privacy, bias mitigation, transparency, and accountability, among other critical aspects. The advantages of AI safety and regulation are evident in their capacity to protect public health, privacy, and fairness. In healthcare, they ensure the accuracy of diagnostic AI systems and safeguard patient data. In remote work and education, they promote equitable access to AI enhanced services. Additionally, AI safety and regulation play a crucial role in supply chain resilience, mental health support, and the development of digital health records and vaccine passports. However, several limitations and challenges need to be acknowledged. Rapid technological advancements often outpace regulatory frameworks, making it challenging to maintain relevance. Global variations in regulations can create complexities for international cooperation. Overregulation can stifle innovation, while a lack of enforcement can render regulations toothless. The future trends in AI safety and regulation will be shaped by the lessons learned from the COVID 19 pandemic. We anticipate global collaboration and standardization efforts, the proliferation of ethical AI frameworks, and sector specific regulations. Transparent AI, accountability laws, and adaptive regulations will play a significant role in shaping the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. In conclusion, AI safety and regulation are essential components of a post COVID world that seeks to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its potential risks. The responsible development and use of AI technologies are crucial in ensuring a secure, equitable, and ethical digital future.

This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.',\n",

So explainability is at least as old as early AI, and a natural consequence of the design of AI systems. While early expert systems consisted of handcrafted knowledge bases that enabled reasoning over narrowly well-defined domains (e.g., INTERNIST, MYCIN), such systems had no learning capabilities and had only primitive uncertainty handling.

To effectively navigate this shift, it is crucial to embrace AI as a contemporary educational trend and establish pedagogical principles for properly utilizing emerging technologies like ChatGPT to promote self-regulation. Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools, educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators, instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers. This paper proposes three key pedagogical principles for integrating AI chatbots in classrooms, informed by Zimmerman’s Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework and Judgment of Learning (JOL). We argue that the current conceptualization of AI chatbots in education is inadequate, so we advocate for the incorporation of goal setting (prompting), self-assessment and feedback, and personalization as three essential educational principles. First, we propose that teaching prompting is important for developing students’ SRL. Second, configuring reverse prompting in the AI chatbot’s capability will help to guide students’ SRL and monitoring for understanding. Third, developing a data-driven mechanism that enables an AI chatbot to provide learning analytics helps learners to reflect on learning and develop SRL strategies. By bringing in Zimmerman’s SRL framework with JOL, we aim to provide educators with guidelines for implementing AI in teaching and learning contexts, with a focus on promoting students’ self-regulation in higher education through AI-assisted pedagogy and instructional design.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'AI-powered learning technologies are increasingly being used to automate and scaffold learning activities (e.g., personalised reminders for completing tasks, automated real-time feedback for improving writing, or recommendations for when and what to study). While the prevailing view is that these technologies generally have a positive effect on student learning, their impact on students’ agency and ability to self-regulate their learning is under-explored. Do students learn from the regular, detailed and personalised feedback provided by AI systems, and will they continue to exhibit similar behaviour in the absence of assistance? Or do they instead continue to rely on AI assistance without learning from it? To contribute to filling this research gap, we conducted a randomised controlled experiment that explored the impact of AI assistance on student agency in the context of peer feedback. With 1625 students across 10 courses, an experiment was conducted using peer review. During the initial four-week period, students were guided by AI features that utilised techniques such as rule-based suggestion detection, semantic similarity, and comparison with previous comments made by the reviewer to enhance their submissions if the feedback provided was deemed insufficiently detailed or general in nature. Over the following four weeks, students were divided into four different groups: control (AI) received prompts, (NR) received no prompts, (SR) received self-monitoring checklists in place of AI prompts, and (SAI) had access to both AI prompts and self-monitoring checklists. Results of the experiment suggest that students tended to rely on rather than learn from AI assistance. If AI assistance was removed, self-regulated strategies could help in filling in the gap but were not as effective as AI assistance. Results also showed that hybrid human-AI approaches that complement AI assistance with self-regulated strategies (SAI) were not more effective than AI assistance on its own. We conclude by discussing the broader benefits, challenges and implications of relying on AI assistance in relation to student agency in a world where we learn, live and work with AI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'When people receive advice while making difficult decisions, they often make better decisions in the moment and also increase their knowledge in the process. However, such incidental learning can only occur when people cognitively engage with the information they receive and process this information thoughtfully. How do people process the information and advice they receive from AI, and do they engage with it deeply enough to enable learning? To answer these questions, we conducted three experiments in which individuals were asked to make nutritional decisions and received simulated AI recommendations and explanations. In the first experiment, we found that when people were presented with both a recommendation and an explanation before making their choice, they made better decisions than they did when they received no such help, but they did not learn. In the second experiment, participants first made their own choice, and only then saw a recommendation and an explanation from AI; this condition also resulted in improved decisions, but no learning. However, in our third experiment, participants were presented with just an AI explanation but no recommendation and had to arrive at their own decision. This condition led to both more accurate decisions and learning gains. We hypothesize that learning gains in this condition were due to deeper engagement with explanations needed to arrive at the decisions. This work provides some of the most direct evidence to date that it may not be sufficient to include explanations together with AI-generated recommendation to ensure that people engage carefully with the AI-provided information. This work also presents one technique that enables incidental learning and, by implication, can help people process AI recommendations and explanations more carefully.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent work has proposed artificial intelligence (AI) models that can learn to decide whether to make a prediction for an instance of a task or to delegate it to a human by considering both parties’ capabilities. In simulations with synthetically generated or context-independent human predictions, delegation can help improve the performance of human-AI teams—compared to humans or the AI model completing the task alone. However, so far, it remains unclear how humans perform and how they perceive the task when they are aware that an AI model delegated task instances to them. In an experimental study with 196 participants, we show that task performance and task satisfaction improve through AI delegation, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation. Additionally, we identify humans’ increased levels of self-efficacy as the underlying mechanism for these improvements in performance and satisfaction.

Yet, even though these contemporary learning systems are useful educational platforms that meet students’ needs, there is still a low number of implemented systems designed to address the concerns and problems faced by many students. Based on this perspective, a systematic mapping of the literature on AI-enabled adaptive learning systems was performed in this work. A total of 147 studies published between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. The major findings and contributions of this paper include the identification of the types of AI-enabled learning interventions used, a visualisation of the co-occurrences of authors associated with major research themes in AI-enabled learning systems and a review of common analytical methods and related techniques utilised in such learning systems. This mapping can serve as a guide for future studies on how to better design AI-enabled learning systems to solve specific learning problems and improve users’ learning experiences.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, there has been a growing public discourse regarding the influence AI will have on the future of work. Simultaneously, considerable critical attention has been given to the implications of AI on gender equality. Far from making precise predictions about the future, this discourse demonstrates that new technologies are instances for renegotiating the relation of gender and work. This paper examines how gender is addressed in news media discourse on AI and the future of work, focusing on Germany. We approach this question from a perspective of feminist technology studies and discourse analysis, exploring a corpus of 178 articles from 2015 to 2021 from German newspapers and newsmagazines. The findings indicate that critical AI and gender knowledge circulates in public discourse in the form of specific discursive frames, thematizing algorithmic bias, automatization and enhancement, and gender stereotypes. As a result, we show that, first, the discourse takes up feminist and scholarly discourse on gender and discusses AI in a way that is informed by social constructivism and standpoint theories. Second, gender appears as a—to some extent intersectional—diversity category which is critical to AI, while at the same time omitting important perspectives. Third, it can be shown that there is a renegotiating of the ideal worker norm taking place, and finally, we argue that the gendered frame of the powerful men developer responsible for AI’s risk is a concept to be challenged.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is finally bringing a multitude of capabilities to machines that were long thought to belong exclusively to the human realm, such as processing natural language or visual information. In this report, we explain how and where AI could affect the German industrial sector by exploring several questions: Which subindustries are most strongly affected by the automation potential of AI? What are the most promising use cases? What are pragmatic recommendations for managers of industrial players planning to harness the power of AI? Highly developed economies like Germany, with a high GDP per capita and challenges such as a quickly aging population, will increasingly need to rely on automation based on AI to achieve GDP targets. About one-third of Germany’s GDP aspiration for 2030 depends on productivity gains. Automation fueled by AI is one of the most significant sources of productivity. By becoming one of the earliest adopters of AI, Germany could even exceed its 2030 GDP target by 4 percent. However, if the country adopts AI more slowly---and productivity is not increased by any other means---it could lag behind its 2030 GDP target by up to one-third. AI is expected to lift performance across all industries and especially in those with a high share of predictable tasks such as Germany's industrial sector. AI-enabled work could raise productivity in Germany by 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually. We selected eight use cases covering three essential business areas (products and services, manufacturing operations, and business processes) to highlight AI’s great potential in the industrial sector. Use cases include topics such as autonomous vehicles, predictive maintenance, collaborative robotics, and supply-chain management. Five pragmatic recommendations help with getting started on the journey toward a fully AI-enabled organization.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is finally bringing a multitude of capabilities to machines which were long thought to belong exclusively to the human realm: processing natural language or visual information, recognizing patterns, and decision making. While AI undoubtedly holds great economic potential for the whole world, in this report we explain how and where AI will likely affect the German industrial sector by exploring several questions: Which subindustries are most strongly affected by the automation potential of AI? What are the most promising use cases? What are pragmatic recommendations for managers of industrial players planning to harness the power of AI? We describe several use cases in which we highlight the impact of AI and aim to quantify it. These use cases were carefully selected based on their economic potential and their ability to demonstrate the benefits of AI in practice. We do not claim that AI – despite its enormous potential – is the silver bullet for every business problem. We realize that AI is very often the enabler for performance improvements whose actual realization requires changing business processes. It is a rapidly evolving field. Thus, the present report needs to be understood as a peek into the future based on the current state of the art. With these caveats we are confident that this report will provide managers in the German industrial sector with valuable guidance on how they can benefit from AI.\",\n",

Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

GenAI offers transformative pedagogical opportunities, while simultaneously posing ethical and academic challenges. Against this backdrop, we outline a practical, simple, and sufficiently comprehensive tool to allow for the integration of GenAI tools into educational assessment: the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS). The AIAS empowers educators to select the appropriate level of GenAI usage in assessments based on the learning outcomes they seek to address. The AIAS offers greater clarity and transparency for students and educators, provides a fair and equitable policy tool for institutions to work with, and offers a nuanced approach which embraces the opportunities of GenAI while recognising that there are instances where such tools may not be pedagogically appropriate or necessary. By adopting a practical, flexible approach that can be implemented quickly, the AIAS can form a much-needed starting point to address the current uncertainty and anxiety regarding GenAI in education. As a secondary objective, we engage with the current literature and advocate for a refocused discourse on GenAI tools in education, one which foregrounds how technologies can help support and enhance teaching and learning, which contrasts with the current focus on GenAI as a facilitator of academic misconduct.',\n",

We make explorative contributions to the body of knowledge in terms of AI use and its corresponding information disclosure. The findings are relevant for practice as they guide the design of AI that fosters information disclosure.',\n",

So many researchers trying to solve this problem from last decades. Using hard AI problems for security is up-and-coming as an exciting new concept so we have to show keen interest in this domain. Hence, in this paper, we are introducing better security parameters based on hard AI problems, explicitly, a novel family of graphical password systems built on top of Captcha technology, which we are proposing Captcha and Graphical Passwords (CaRP). CaRP is both a Captcha and a graphical password system. CaRP sort some security problems, such as online guessing attacks, relay attacks and shoulder-surfing attacks. Especially, a CaRP password can be establish only probabilistically by automatic online guessing attacks even if the password is in the search position. CaRP also offers a novel approach to address the well-known image hotspot problem in popular graphical password systems, such as PassPoints that often leads to less password choices. CaRP is not a universal solution but it offers reasonable security and usability and it may use few practical applications for getting better online security such as banking, railway reservation etc.',\n",

Because of this, it developed a Multilingual Conversational Bot based on Natural Language Processing NLP to provide free primary healthcare education, information, advice to chronic patients. The study introduces a novel computer application acting as a personal virtual doctor that has been opportunely designed and extensively trained to interact with patients like human beings. This application is related to a server less architecture and it aggregates the services of a doctor by providing preventive measures, home remedies, interactive counseling sessions, healthcare tips, and symptoms covering the most prevalent diseases in rural India. The paper proposes a conversational bot for delivering telehealth in India to increase the patients access to healthcare knowledge and leverage of artificial intelligence to bridge the gap of demand and supply of human healthcare providers.

To seize this opportunity for innovation in assessment practice, we conducted a survey to understand both the educators' and students' perspectives on the issue. We measure and compare attitudes of both stakeholders across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Responses from 389 students and 36 educators across two universities indicate moderate usage of generative AI, consensus for which types of assessments are most impacted, and concerns about academic integrity. Educators prefer adapted assessments that assume AI will be used and encourage critical thinking, but students' reaction is mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, higher-order thinking, and authentic applications.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A common criteria for Explainable AI (XAI) is to support users in establishing appropriate trust in the AI – rejecting advice when it is incorrect, and accepting advice when it is correct. Previous findings suggest that explanations can cause an over-reliance on AI (overly accepting advice). Explanations that evoke appropriate trust are even more challenging for decision-making tasks that are difficult for humans and AI. For this reason, we study decision-making by non-experts in the high-uncertainty domain of stock trading. We compare the effectiveness of three different explanation styles (influenced by inductive, abductive, and deductive reasoning) and the role of AI confidence in terms of a) the users’ reliance on the XAI interface elements (charts with indicators, AI prediction, explanation), b) the correctness of the decision (task performance), and c) the agreement with the AI’s prediction. In contrast to previous work, we look at interactions between different aspects of decision-making, including AI correctness, and the combined effects of AI confidence and explanations styles. Our results show that specific explanation styles (abductive and deductive) improve the user’s task performance in the case of high AI confidence compared to inductive explanations. In other words, these styles of explanations were able to invoke correct decisions (for both positive and negative decisions) when the system was certain. In such a condition, the agreement between the user’s decision and the AI prediction confirms this finding, highlighting a significant agreement increase when the AI is correct. This suggests that both explanation styles are suitable for evoking appropriate trust in a confident AI.',\n",

During this time, questions of how these programs compared in kind to humans have surfaced and led to beneficial interdisciplinary discussions, but conceptual progress has been slower than technological progress. Within the past decade, the term agency has taken on new import as intelligent agents have become a noticeable part of our everyday lives. Research on autonomous vehicles and personal assistants has expanded into private industry with new and increasingly capable products surfacing as a matter of routine. This wider use of AI technologies has raised questions about legal and moral agency at the highest levels of government (National Science and Technology Council 2016) and drawn the interest of other academic disciplines and the general public. Within this context, the notion of an intelligent agent in AI is too coarse and in need of refinement.

       "  'abstract': 'Manually indexing documents for subject-based access is a labour-intensive process that can be automated using AI technology. Algorithms for text classification must be trained and tested with examples of indexed documents, which can be obtained from existing bibliographic databases and digital collections.The National Library of Finland has created Annif, an open source toolkit for automated subject indexing and classification. Annif is multilingual, independent of the indexing vocabulary, and modular. It integrates many text classification algorithms, including Maui, fastText, Omikuji, and a neural network model based on TensorFlow. Best results can often be obtained by combining several algorithms. Many document corpora have been used for training and evaluating Annif. Finding the algorithms and configurations that give the best quality is an ongoing effort.In May 2020, we launched Finto AI, a service for automated subject indexing based on Annif. It provides a simple Web form for obtaining subject suggestions for text. The functionality is also available as a REST API. Many document repositories and the cataloguing system for electronic publications at the National Library of Finland are using it to integrate semi-automated subject indexing into their metadata workflows. In the future, we are going to extend Annif with more algorithms and new functionality, and to integrate Finto AI with other metadata management workflows.',\n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is of strategic importance for the EU, with the European Commission recently stating that ‘artificial intelligence with a purpose can make Europe a world leader’. For this to happen, though, the EU needs to put in place the right ethical and legal framework. This Foresight Brief argues that such a framework must be solidly founded on regulation – which can be achieved by updating existing legislation – and that it must pay specific attention to the protection of workers. Workers are in a subordinate position in relation to their employers, and in the EU’s eagerness to win the AI race, their rights may be overlooked. This is why a protective and enforceable legal framework must be developed, with the participation of social partners.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"There is both much optimisim and pessimism around artificial intelligence (AI) today. The optimists are investing millions of dollars, and even in some cases billions of dollars into AI. The pessimists, on the other hand, predict that AI will end many things: jobs, warfare, and even the human race. Both the optimists and the pessimists often appeal to the idea of a technological singularity, a point in time where machine intelligence starts to run away, and a new, more intelligent 'species' starts to inhabit the earth. If the optimists are right, this will be a moment that fundamentally changes our economy and our society. If the pessimists are right, this will be a moment that also fundamentally changes our economy and our society. It is therefore very worthwhile spending some time deciding if either of them might be right.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Nowadays, the mobile computing paradigm and the widespread diffusion of mobile devices are quickly changing and replacing many common assumptions about software architectures and interaction/communication models. The environment, in particular, or more generally, the so-called user context is claiming a central role in everyday's use of cellular phones, PDAs, etc. This is due to the huge amount of data suggested by the surrounding environment that can be helpful in many common tasks. For instance, the current context can help a search engine to refine the set of results in a useful way, providing the user with a more suitable and exploitable information. Moreover, we can take full advantage of this new data source by ''pushing'' active contents towards mobile devices, empowering the latter with new features (e.g., applications) that can allow the user to fruitfully interact with the current context. Following this vision, mobile devices become dynamic self-adapting tools, according to the user needs and the possibilities offered by the environment. The present work proposes MoBe: an approach for providing a basic infrastructure for pervasive context-aware applications on mobile devices, in which AI techniques (namely a principled combination of rule-based systems, Bayesian networks and ontologies) are applied to context inference. The aim is to devise a general inferential framework to make easier the development of context-aware applications by integrating the information coming from physical and logical sensors (e.g., position, agenda) and reasoning about this information in order to infer new and more abstract contexts.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Labeling data is an important step in the supervised machine learning lifecycle. It is a laborious human activity comprised of repeated decision making: the human labeler decides which of several potential labels to apply to each example. Prior work has shown that providing AI assistance can improve the accuracy of binary decision tasks. However, the role of AI assistance in more complex data-labeling scenarios with a larger set of labels has not yet been explored. We designed an AI labeling assistant that uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm to predict the most probable labels for each example. We leverage these predictions to provide assistance in two ways: (i) providing a label recommendation and (ii) reducing the labeler’s decision space by focusing their attention on only the most probable labels. We conducted a user study (n=54) to evaluate an AI-assisted interface for data labeling in this context. Our results highlight that the AI assistance improves both labeler accuracy and speed, especially when the labeler finds the correct label in the reduced label space. We discuss findings related to the presentation of AI assistance and design implications for intelligent labeling interfaces.',\n",

But in this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization. The scale of this system is almost beyond human imagining. How can we begin to see it, to grasp its immensity and complexity as a connected form?

       "  'abstract': 'main objective of this paper is split in two parts. Firstly, it is needed to verify if there exists a cultural bias for data science in Spanish language. Secondly, we have to check how privacy data is controlled in apps, which use contact tracing techniques, and also electronic devices such as smartwatches. To carry out the first part of the study, we have investigated about datasets in English and Spanish language and its technical structure. As well as, it has been designed a database, used for demonstrating the cultural bias that exists between English and Spanish language. For the second phase, it has been explored themes such as smartwatches for minors, adding a comparative table of privacy about important consumption brands. Following the assessment, it is observed that there exists a cultural bias between Spanish and English language. In fact, the results shows that a 70% of analysed datasets are written in English. The lack of inversion in technological education is one of the reasons why Spanish speakers countries lack of an appropriate technological education. On 14 May 2020, the newspaper The Economist writes an article about the involvement of countries on technological innovation. These countries do not include Spain because Spanish inversion does not cover more than 1,25% out of the PIB total. Europe has been driven by achieving the objective of reaching, at least, 3% in 2020. So, Spain is lower than the European media. On contrary, there are other countries such as South Korea, Denmark, and Sweden, which the barrier of 3% is reached and even 4% . Consequently, it has negative effects for technological education for Spain. One proof of this is the results of the PISA index (Program for International Evaluation of Student), where Spanish obtain fewer qualifications in technology, science, and mathematics than the average of OCDE countries (Organization for economic Cooperation Development). Apart from Spain, Chile, México, and Columbia are also at the bottom of the list . Moreover, this paper shows data that warn us about the importance of safeguard our security towards the technological breakthrough. Centralizing decisions in collaborative and international organizations by applying: efficient, ethics and deontological strategies could be a possible solution. \\xa0',\n",

A questionnaire is missing that is deeply grounded in the existing literature on AI literacy, is modularly applicable depending on the goals, and includes further psychological competencies in addition to the typical facets of AIL. This paper presents the development and validation of a questionnaire considering the desiderata described above. We derived items to represent different facets of AI literacy and psychological competencies, such as problem-solving, learning, and emotion regulation in regard to AI. We collected data from 300 German-speaking adults to confirm the factorial structure. The result is the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) for AI literacy with the facets Use & apply AI, Understand AI, Detect AI, and AI Ethics and the ability to Create AI as a separate construct, and AI Self-efficacy in learning and problem-solving and AI Self-management (i.e., AI persuasion literacy and emotion regulation).

Testing if a particular parameter set of such a model is\\nexcluded by LHC data is a challenge: It requires the time consuming generation\\nof scattering events, the simulation of the detector response, the event\\nreconstruction, cross section calculations and analysis code to test against\\nseveral hundred signal regions defined by the ATLAS and CMS experiment. In the\\nBSM-AI project we attack this challenge with a new approach.

About\\n300,000 pMSSM model sets - each tested with 200 signal regions by ATLAS - have\\nbeen used to train and validate SUSY-AI.

The knowledge about Ford's manufacturing processes is contained in an ontology originally developed using the KL-ONE representation language and methodology.

       "  'abstract': 'Recently, eXplainable AI (XAI) research has focused on the use of counterfactual explanations to address interpretability, algorithmic recourse, and bias in AI system decision-making. The proponents of these algorithms claim they meet users’ requirements for counterfactual explanations. For instance, many claim that the output of their algorithms work as explanations because they prioritise \"plausible\", äctionable\" or \"causally important\" features in their generated counterfactuals. However, very few of these claims have been tested in controlled psychological studies, and we know very little about which aspects of counterfactual explanations help users to understand AI system decisions. Furthermore, we do not know whether counterfactual explanations are an advance on more traditional causal explanations that have a much longer history in AI (in explaining expert systems and decision trees). Accordingly, we carried out two user studies to (i) test a fundamental distinction in feature-types, between categorical and continuous features, and (ii) compare the relative effectiveness of counterfactual and causal explanations. The studies used a simulated, automated decision-making app that determined safe driving limits after drinking alcohol, based on predicted blood alcohol content, and user responses were measured objectively (users’ predictive accuracy) and subjectively (users’ satisfaction and trust judgments). Study 1 (N=127) showed that users understand explanations referring to categorical features more readily than those referring to continuous features. It also discovered a dissociation between objective and subjective measures: counterfactual explanations elicited higher accuracy of predictions than no-explanation control descriptions but no higher accuracy than causal explanations, yet counterfactual explanations elicited greater satisfaction and trust judgments than causal explanations. Study 2 (N=211) found that users were more accurate for categorically-transformed features compared to continuous ones, and also replicated the results of Study 1. The findings delineate important boundary conditions for current and future counterfactual explanation methods in XAI.',\n",

Our\\r\\nfindings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are\\r\\noptimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection\\r\\nis not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race,\\r\\nsuch as underlying disease distribution.

In a layered architecture, systems dynamics methods with differential models prevail on the lower, data-intensive levels, but on higher levels, AI-type methods are used. Knowledge about the world is geared to classes of objects and subjects. Subjects are defined as objects with additional capabilities of sensing, data processing, decision making, and control application. Specialist processes for visual detection and efficient tracking of class members have been developed. On the upper levels, individual instantiations of these class members are analyzed jointly in the task context, yielding the situation for decision making. As an application, vertebrate-type vision for tasks in vehicle guidance in naturally perturbed environments was investigated with a distributed PC system.

However, being co-located tends to be associated with other dimensions of proximity, such as social ties or a shared organizational environment. To account for such factors, multiple dimensions of proximity have been proposed, including cognitive, institutional, organizational, social and geographical proximity. Since they strongly interrelate, disentangling these dimensions and their respective impact on collaboration is challenging. To address this issue, we propose various methods for measuring different dimensions of proximity. We then present an approach to compare and rank them with respect to the extent to which they indicate co-publications and co-inventions. We adapt the HypTrails approach, which was originally developed to explain human navigation, to co-author and co-inventor graphs. We evaluate this approach on a subset of the German research community, specifically academic authors and inventors active in research on artificial intelligence (AI). We find that social proximity and cognitive proximity are more important for the emergence of collaboration than geographic proximity.',\n",

To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented.

Specifically, based on our review of previous literature, we highlight three desirable properties that ideal AI explanations should satisfy—improve people’s understanding of the AI model, help people recognize the model uncertainty, and support people’s calibrated trust in the model. Through randomized controlled experiments, we evaluate whether four types of common model-agnostic explainable AI methods satisfy these properties on two types of decision making tasks where people perceive themselves as having different levels of domain expertise in (i.e., recidivism prediction and forest cover prediction). Our results show that the effects of AI explanations are largely different on decision making tasks where people have varying levels of domain expertise in, and many AI explanations do not satisfy any of the desirable properties for tasks that people have little domain expertise in. Further, for decision making tasks that people are more knowledgeable, feature contribution explanation is shown to satisfy more desiderata of AI explanations, while the explanation that is considered to resemble how human explain decisions (i.e., counterfactual explanation) does not seem to improve calibrated trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for improving the design of XAI methods to better support human decision making.',\n",

Brooks proposal boils down to the architectural rejection of central control in intelligent agents—Which, however, turns out to be crucial. Some of more recent cognitive science suggests that we might do well to dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors. If this paradigm shift is achieved, Brooks' proposal for cognition without representation appears promising for full-blown intelligent agents—Though not for conscious agents.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'IT support is under growing pressure to ensure efficient, flexible, and scalable use of digital technologies (Kumbakara, 2008). As a result, technical support staff is affected by monotonous work and work overload (Schmidt et al., 2022). Our research aims to augment the precarious workplace of support agents with artificial intelligence (AI). To incorporate an employee-centered perspective a priori and ensure positive impacts, we propose a framework for combining work design theory (e.g. Demerouti et al., 2001) and design science theory (Peffers et al., 2007, Niehaves & Ortbach 2016). The advances in AI promise to leverage large potential in optimizing and enhancing service processes and workplaces (Huang & Rust, 2018, de Keyser, 2019). Introducing AI into service processes, imply effects on work characteristics (Larivière et al., 2017). By combining human and artificial intelligence we propose hybrid intelligence (Dellermann et al., 2019) as a suitable solution for mitigating the persistent issues of support workers and the possible negative impacts of AI. To a great extent, IS research emphasizes the implied impacts of AI use in workplaces (Verma & Singh 2022, Wang et al., 2020). As such, work design models are widely used to empirically evaluate the impacts of AI design (Sturm & Peters, 2020), but are rarely utilized to substantiate the design of AI-augmented work systems. Only Poser et al. (2022) and Zschech et al. (2021) recently applied such models. The goal of this paper is to overcome the lack of work design in design science research (DSR) for AI-based systems and to steer the development into desired socio-technological configurations. The here presented work is expected to answer : How can work design theory inform the design of AI-augmented workplaces? RQ1 How should a hybrid intelligence system be designed to augment IT support agents’ workplaces by incorporating work design theory? \\r\\nRQ2 To systematically design the integration of AI, we make use of the DSR paradigm (Peffers et al., 2007). We first interview support agents and utilize the organizing move theory of Pentland (1992) and the technical support work theory of Das (2003) to ensure relevance. Based on a review of the IS literature on work design theories, we then derive a preliminary theoretical framework (Paul & Benito, 2018) RQ1. The framework represents a kernel theory for the development of meta design requirements. Contributing to the second research question, we design and subsequently evaluate the augmentation based on work-related outcomes RQ2.',\n",

This is especially applicable in high-dimensionality datasets, where patterns and relationships are often not immediately apparent to investigators.

Using OJs in CS1, instructors select problems to compose assignment lists, whereas students submit their code solutions and receive instantaneous feedback. Whilst this process reduces the instructors' workload in evaluating students' code, selecting problems to compose assignments is arduous. Recently, recommender systems have been proposed by the literature to support OJ users. Nonetheless, there is a lack of recommenders fitted for CS1 courses and the ones found in the literature have not been assessed by the target users in a real educational scenario. It is worth noting that hybrid human/AI systems are claimed to potentially surpass isolated human or AI. In this study, we adapted and evaluated a state-of-the-art hybrid human/AI recommender to support CS1 instructors in selecting problems to compose variations of CS1 assignments. We compared data-driven measures (e.g., time students take to solve problems, number of logical lines of code, and hit rate) extracted from student logs whilst solving programming problems from assignments created by instructors versus when solving assignments in collaboration with an adaptation of cutting-edge hybrid/AI method. As a result, employing a data analysis comparing experimental and control conditions using multi-level regressions, we observed that the recommender provided problems compatible with human-selected in all data-driven measures tested.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The idea that human cognition is, or can be understood as, a form of computation is a useful conceptual tool for cognitive science. It was a foundational assumption during the birth of cognitive science as a multidisciplinary field, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) as one of its contributing fields. One conception of AI in this context is as a provider of computational tools (frameworks, concepts, formalisms, models, proofs, simulations, etc.) that support theory building in cognitive science. The contemporary field of AI, however, has taken the theoretical possibility of explaining human cognition as a form of computation to imply the practical feasibility of realising human(-like or -level) cognition in factual computational systems; and, the field frames this realisation as a short-term inevitability. Yet, as we formally prove herein, creating systems with human(-like or -level) cognition is intrinsically computationally intractable. This means that any factual AI systems created in the short-run are at best decoys. When we think these systems capture something deep about ourselves and our thinking, we induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our cognition. In other words, AI in current practice is deteriorating our theoretical understanding of cognition rather than advancing and enhancing it. The situation could be remediated by releasing the grip of the currently dominant view on AI and by returning to the idea of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science. In reclaiming this older idea of AI, however, it is important not to repeat conceptual mistakes of the past (and present) that brought us to where we are today.',\n",

It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as Big Data has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning -- the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge -- has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications. Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of data science, and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.\",\n",

Yet, current XAI systems are rarely evaluated by measuring the performance of human+AI teams on actual decision-making tasks. We conducted two online experiments and one in-person think-aloud study to evaluate two currently common techniques for evaluating XAI systems: (1) using proxy, artificial tasks such as how well humans predict the AI's decision from the given explanations, and (2) using subjective measures of trust and preference as predictors of actual performance. The results of our experiments demonstrate that evaluations with proxy tasks did not predict the results of the evaluations with the actual decision-making tasks. Further, the subjective measures on evaluations with actual decision-making tasks did not predict the objective performance on those same tasks.

Our evaluation with six pathologists demonstrates that it can 1) reduce time needed with maintained quality, 2) build user trust progressively, and 3) learn and improve from use. We describe our iterative design process, model development, and key features. Through interviews, design choices are related to the overall user experience.

       "  'abstract': 'Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to a steep rise in the adoption of AI to augment or support human decision-making across domains. There has been an increasing body of work addressing the benefits of model interpretability and explanations to help end-users or other stakeholders decipher the inner workings of the so-called ”black box AI systems”. Yet, little is currently understood about the role of modalities through which explanations can be communicated (e.g., text, visualizations, or audio) to inform, augment, and shape human decision-making. In our work, we address this research gap through the lens of a credibility assessment system. Considering the deluge of information available through various channels, people constantly make decisions while considering the perceived credibility of the information they consume. However, with an increasing information overload, assessing the credibility of the information we encounter is a non-trivial task. To help users in this task, automated credibility assessment systems have been devised as decision support systems in various contexts (e.g., assessing the credibility of news or social media posts). However, for these systems to be effective in supporting users, they need to be trusted and understood. Explanations have been shown to play an essential role in informing users’ reliance on decision support systems. In this paper, we investigate the influence of explanation modalities on an AI-assisted credibility assessment task. We use a between-subjects experiment (N = 375), spanning six different explanation modalities, to evaluate the role of explanation modality on the accuracy of AI-assisted decision outcomes, the perceived system trust among users, and system usability. Our results indicate that explanations play a significant role in shaping users’ reliance on the decision support system and, thereby, the accuracy of decisions made. We found that users performed with higher accuracy while assessing the credibility of statements in the presence of explanations. We also found that users had a significantly harder time agreeing on statement credibility without explanations. With explanations present, text and audio explanations were more effective than graphic explanations. Additionally, we found that combining graphical with text and/or audio explanations were significantly effective. Such combinations of modalities led to a higher user performance than using graphical explanations alone.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The idea of temporal abstraction, i.e. learning, planning and representing the world at multiple time scales, has been a constant thread in AI research, spanning sub-fields from classical planning and search to control and reinforcement learning. For example, programming a robot typically involves making decisions over a set of controllers, rather than working at the level of motor torques. While temporal abstraction is a very natural concept, learning such abstractions with no human input has proved quite daunting. In this paper, we present a general architecture, called option-critic, which allows learning temporal abstractions automatically, end-to-end, simply from the agent's experience. This approach allows continual learning and provides interesting qualitative and quantitative results in several tasks.\",\n",

I maintain that explicable algorithms do, in fact, strengthen these ethical principles in medicine, e.g., in terms of direct patient–physician contact, as well as on a longer-term epistemological level by facilitating scientific progress that is informed through practice. With this article, I will therefore attempt to counter arguments against demands for explicable AI in medicine that are based on a notion of “whatever heals is right.” I will elucidate my elaboration on the positive aspects of explicable AI in medicine as well as by pointing out risks of non-explicable AI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mythological tale of Sagar Manthan, or the churning of the ocean, holds deeper parallels with modern deep sea mining endeavours. This paper explores how the narrative of Sagar Manthan can be metaphorically applied to the context of deep sea mining in todays world. By drawing comparisons between the extraction of Amrita nectar of immortality and valuable minerals from the ocean floor, we examine the applications of deep sea mining technologies and the potential rewards it offers in meeting the global demand for critical minerals. Deep sea mining has emerged as a potential solution to meet the ever increasing global demand for valuable metals and minerals. With depleting terrestrial reserves and growing demand for these resources, exploiting the vast mineral wealth lying on the ocean floor has become an attractive proposition. However, the practice of deep sea mining raises significant environmental, economic, and technological challenges. This paper provides an in depth analysis of the concept of deep sea mining, exploring its potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as the current state of technology and its impact on the marine environment.
